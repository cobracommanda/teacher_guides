<h4>Draw Inferences</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What do Peterson’s actions reveal about him?</p>
<p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> I can tell that he is an honest person because when
  his wife gives him the blue carbuncle he tries to return it to the person
  who lost it rather than keep it for himself.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Text Evidence:</strong> “‘See here, sir! See what my wife found in its
  crop!’ He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a
  brilliantly scintillating blue stone . . .” (p. 5)
</p>
<h4>Determine Key Details</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Question:</strong> How did the blue carbuncle get from John Ryder’s
  possession to <br />Mr. Henry Baker’s possession?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> John Ryder hid the jewel inside a goose that was sold
  by his sister to a salesman. The salesman sold the goose to Mr. Windigate,
  who then gave it to Mr. Baker, who had been paying money every week so he
  could get a goose at Christmas.
</p>
<h4>Use Context Clues</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Question:</strong> Reread the second paragraph on page 15. What does
  the word <strong>roughs</strong> mean? What evidence help the reader define
  the word?
</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> tough guys; gangsters</p>
<p>
  <strong>Text Evidence:</strong> “I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who
  assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird.” (p.&#160;15)
