                            several terms in our book that are present participles. Present participles are words that
                            end with </span><span class="Tchr-tlk-b-ital">-ing</span><span class="Tchr-tlk"> and
                            describe action that is happening. Sometimes present participles are used as adjectives to
                            describe nouns. In this sentence, </span><span class="Tchr-tlk-b-ital">stinging
                            cells</span><span class="Tchr-tlk"> is a present participle phrase. </span><span
                            class="Tchr-tlk-b-ital">Stinging</span><span class="Tchr-tlk"> is an adjective that
                            describes </span><span class="Tchr-tlk-b-ital">cells</span><span class="Tchr-tlk">. At other
                            times, present participle words are used with verbs such as </span><span
                            class="Tchr-tlk-b-ital">am</span><span class="Tchr-tlk"> or </span><span
                            class="Tchr-tlk-b-ital">are</span><span class="Tchr-tlk">. For example, you might say, “I am
                            waiting for the bus” or “We are waiting for the bus.”</span></p>
