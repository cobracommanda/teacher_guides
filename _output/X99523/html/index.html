            way there, they saw Zachary. Some of the baseball players started making fun of Zachary and then they broke

            from doing so either. Stephen felt terrible. He had to decide if he should tell an adult and get his
            teammates in trouble before the game or stay quiet so that his team could still play the game. He decided to
            tell the principal. The kids who bullied Zachary got in trouble and were not allowed to play in the
