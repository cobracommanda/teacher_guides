                            basic chemicals to make their own food. Consumers are living things that can’t produce their
                            own food. They get energy by eating producers or other consumers. There are different kinds
                            of consumers: herbivores (plant eaters), carnivores (meat eaters), omnivores (eat plants and
                            animals), and decomposers (eat waste). Energy moves from producers up to different levels of
                            consumers through food chains that make up food webs in an ecosystem. Energy decreases with
                            each transfer from producer to consumer.</span></p>
