                        “Plynchins.” Plynchins can listen to thoughts, have hair that is always moving, and have a
                        self-contained ecosystem, which means they can live anywhere. Look at our main character,
                        Varuna, on page 8. The story also has creatures and planetary bodies that speak. Look at the
