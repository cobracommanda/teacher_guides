In hot climates, some animals stay cool by burrowing underground during the hot day and feeding at night. Plants have adaptations for the heat, too, such as leaf coatings that keep them cool.

In places with lots of rain, for example, plants have a leaf adaptation in which they release much of the water the roots have absorbed back into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, plants in dry climates store water or have very long roots to reach underground water.</span></p>

The tundra is dry and cold with animals and plants adapted to its long winters and harsh wind. The taiga also has dry, cold winters. Its coniferous trees’ needle-shaped leaves shed snow and allow wind to pass through.  In the temperate deciduous forest, trees shed their leaves in autumn and grow new leaves in spring. In the grassland, a whole year’s rain falls within a few weeks. Plants grow quickly during the wet season and rest during the dry period.  In the tropical rain forest’s hot, wet season, which lasts most of the year, trees grow tall and thousands of species live together. The temperate rain forest with its mild, wet winters and cool, foggy summers is home to the largest trees on Earth. Birds, insects, and mammals are adapted to eat the trees’ leaves, seeds, and berries.  Some desert biomes are hot and others are cold, but all are very dry.</span></p>
