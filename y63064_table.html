<p>Use these questions to extend close reading or challenge students who do not need modeling or differentiated
    practice.</p>
<h4>Draw Inferences</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why doesn’t anyone step in to help Oliver when Nancy kidnaps him off the street?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Nancy pretends that she is Oliver’s governess. She makes it seem as if he stole the books and
    ran away from home. The people on the street think she is taking him home.</p>
<p><strong>Text Evidence:</strong> “Oliver! You naughty boy! Running away from home like. . . . You rascal! Cooperate!” (p.
    17)</p>
<h4>Determine Key Details</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What task does Mr. Brownlow give Oliver?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> He asks Oliver to return some books to the bookstall and give the owner a large sum of money.
    (p. 13)</p>
<h4>Use Context Clues</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Reread the stage directions at the top of page 18. What does the term <strong>scuffle</strong>
    mean? What evidence on pages 17 and 18 help the reader define the word?</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> a fight or struggle between people</p>
<p><strong>Text Evidence:</strong> “She creeps behind him, then captures him in the sheet.” (p. 17) <br />“. . . OLIVER
    manages to peek his head out of the sheet, though NANCY does have a good hold on him.” (p. 18)</p>
