Each freshwater biome contains living organisms adapted to the local conditions.  Plants and animals in wetlands are adapted to the seasonal changes in water levels. Lakes and ponds contain species that thrive in both the light-filled shallow waters and deep, dark depths. Wildlife near rivers and streams are adapted to the constantly moving water. Lush plants grow in estuaries, where a river’s freshwater meets the ocean’s salt water.</th></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table>",

The damage includes decreasing populations of aquatic life, pollution, destruction of large areas of wetlands, and changing weather patterns. With conservation efforts, such as limiting the removal of wildlife, establishing laws to protect habitats, and creating parks and reserves, people can reverse the damage and prevent further destruction.</th></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table>",
