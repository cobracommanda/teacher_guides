		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>As you read this chapter, you will use a strategy called Q-Notes to help you understand the characteristics of each marine biome.</span></p>
		<p>Display the Q-Notes sample shown in the right margin.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>The Q-Notes process is a form of note-taking. As you read, write down questions in the left column. You can do this by rewriting the headings, subheadings, and topic sentences as questions. Continue reading to find the answers, and record them in the right column of the Q-Notes chart. Q-Notes help you focus on the most important information in a text.</span></p>

		<p>Show students how you form a question from the topic sentence, <span>What are the ocean’s three major sections, or zones? </span> Write the question in the left column of the Q-Notes chart. Then have students read to find the answer. Have them record their answers in the right column, using a short answer, picture, or any form of note-taking that effectively helps them capture the information. Circulate to monitor and provide help as needed. Remind students that asking questions about what they read will help them focus on and summarize the key ideas in each chapter.</p>
		<p>Summarize Key Concepts:<span> Think and Write Together</span></p>

		<p>As a group, construct a two- to three-sentence written summary of the key ideas in the chapter. If students need more support to summarize the text, explicitly model strategies for summarizing.</p>
		<p>Model Summarizing</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>When we summarize, we include only the most important information in a text. We look for the central ideas. We don’t include all of the details. Let’s summarize a section of this chapter together.</span></p>
		<p>Reread page 13.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>This page is about the ocean’s disphotic, or twilight, zone. I ask myself, “What is the central idea the author wants me to understand about the disphotic zone?”</span></p>
		<p>Allow responses. Support students to recognize that the author wants readers to understand where in the ocean the disphotic zone is and what lives there. As part of the explanation, the author describes adaptations of some animals that live in the disphotic zone. While this is helpful in understanding the characteristics of this part of the ocean, it is not essential to the summary.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>In my summary, I will focus on what the disphotic zone is and what lives there.</span></p>

			<li>Sample answers (answers may vary): Reduce pollution. Abide by laws against overhunting or overfishing an area.</li>
			<li>Sample answers (answers may vary):  a) Laws and agencies help protect endangered species, limit water pollution, protect wetland areas, maintain parks and reserves, limit fishing in areas, reduce global climate change. b) Make good decisions about kinds of fish you eat, conserve water, don’t pollute an area, recycle.</li>
			<li>A(n) biome is a community with similar conditions. In each biome, plants and animals have adaptations that help them survive. The largest aquatic biome is the ocean, or marine biome. About 97% of Earth’s surface water is salt water. Freshwater makes up the remaining 3%. When water collects in low places, ponds and lakes can form. A(n) estuary is where freshwater biomes and marine (or saltwater) biomes come together. Overfishing and pollution can lead to extinction of certain plant and animal species. Conservation is necessary to ensure the health of Earth’s aquatic biomes.</li>

		<p>Aquatic Biomes: Content Assessment</p>
		<p><span><span>Directions:</span></span><span> </span>Use what you have learned about aquatic biomes to answer the questions below.</p>
		<p>Chapter 1</p>
		<ol>
			<li> Name the three categories of marine biomes.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>oceans, coral reefs, and seashores</p>
		<ol>
			<li> If you were to walk along a seashore, what things could you do to help keep the seashore biome healthy?<br /><br /><br /></li>
			<li> Plants and animals have different adaptations that allow them to survive in the ocean zones where they live. One major factor affecting each zone is sunlight. How are animals and plants in each zone adapted to varying levels of sunlight?</li>
		</ol>
		<p><span>Chapter 2</span></p>
		<ol>
			<li> What are the freshwater biomes?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>wetlands, ponds, lakes, streams, and rivers</p>
		<ol>
			<li> How are lakes and ponds similar to streams and rivers? How are they different? <br />Use the Venn diagram below to record your answers.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Lakes and ponds: water collects; no outlet; edges warm and sunny; standing water; Streams and rivers: water comes from runoff of rain and snow, moving water; Both: freshwater biomes; plants grow in water; plants grow near edges; animals live in water; animals come to edge of water for food</p>
		<ol>
			<li> Estuaries are vital for connecting marine and freshwater biomes. What impact would a very wet, snowy winter have on an estuary? What about a very dry winter?</li>
