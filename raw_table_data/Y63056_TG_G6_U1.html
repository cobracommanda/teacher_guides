		<p>Read aloud the supporting question on page 6: <span>How have Earth’s oceans evolved over time to attain their current defining features?</span></p>
		<p><span>Set a purpose. </span></p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>As you read this chapter, you will use a strategy called Interactive Notes to help you understand how Earth’s oceans have evolved over time to attain their current defining features.</span></p>
		<p>Display the Interactive Notes sample shown below. </p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>Interactive Notes is a form of note taking. Before you read a chapter, you’ll record your thoughts, text evidence, questions, and predictions in the “Before” column, and take notes in response in the “During” column. After you finish a section, you’ll summarize what you read by making judgments in the third column about the most important information in the text. The bottom of the chart provides space for you to summarize the entire chapter. </span></p>
		<p>Preview pages 6–7 by reading the chapter title and headings and looking at the photos. Model how you use the “Before” column of the Interactive Notes to write your predictions and ideas about what you’ll read on these pages. Then read aloud the pages, and model how to complete the “During” column. Finally, in the “After” column, identify the most important points you read about. </p>
		<p>Have students create an Interactive Notes chart on notebook paper, or distribute copies of BLM 1.</p>
		<p>Instruct students to preview pages 8–9 and record thoughts, text evidence, key words, questions, and predictions in the “Before” column. Remind students to use these notes as they read the pages, and to react to the reading by taking notes in the “During” column. Finally, have students summarize by making judgments about what information is most important. Explain that making judgments about what we read helps us to better understand the text. Circulate to monitor and provide help as needed.  </p>
		<p>Summarize Key Concepts: <span>Think and Write Together</span></p>
		<p>Invite students to share their Interactive Notes. What did they predict the text would be about and what questions did they ask about the text? What did they judge as being the most important information? Allow time for students to share and discuss their chapter summaries with the class. </p>
		<p>Use the Sentence Frames to Support Collaborative Conversation for English learners. </p>

		<p>Reread the “Vertical Zones” section on page 14. </p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>There is a lot of information in this section. I ask myself, “What is the central idea the author wants me to understand about the ocean’s vertical zones?”</span></p>
		<p>Allow responses. Support students to recognize that the author wants readers to know that the sea is divided into three zones, or layers, based on depth and the amount of sunlight they get. The author provides additional details about the depth and temperatures of the different zones.  </p>

		<p>Reread the “Science to Science” sidebar on page 9.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span><span> This sidebar is about the effect climate change has had on sea level. In the second paragraph, the author describes how rising global temperatures affect sea levels. The signal word </span><span>causing</span><span> in the second sentence is a clue to a cause-and-effect text structure. As I read on, I find out that rising temperatures cause ice sheets to melt. The words </span><span>as a result</span><span> in the next sentence signal the effect caused by melting ice sheets: rising sea levels.

		<p><span>Explain that the question asks the reader to find clues in the text that help the reader define the word.</span></p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>This text uses words and phrases specific to the study of Earth’s oceans. Some are defined in context, but others are not. We have to look for clues to help us define them. Sometimes the clues are descriptions. We’re going to read closely to figure out the meaning of words using descriptions in context. Knowing how to do this will help us read many kinds of complex texts. Let’s pay close attention to the text where the word </span><span>hydrosphere </span><span>appears and look for descriptions to help us figure out the meaning</span>.</p>
		<p>Reread paragraph 1 on page 6. Highlight the boldfaced term <span>hydrosphere</span>.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span><span> I can figure out the meaning of this word using clues in the sentence. The author describes the hydrosphere as being 97 % oceans and seas. So </span><span>hydrosphere</span><span> must mean “the part of Earth that is made up of water.” I can check my definition in the glossary if I’m unsure.</span></p>

		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>I’m going to show you how I make inferences when I read. When we infer, we use information from the text to form an understanding that is not directly stated in the text. To make an inference, I need to read the text very closely and think about what the author is saying. I also need to support the inference I make with evidence from the text to make sure that my inference is sound, or makes sense. </span></p>
		<p>Reread pages 8–9 while students follow along.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span><span> In the last sentence, the author makes the inference that our planet and its seas will look very different than they do today. The evidence she shares on these pages supports that inference. For example, s</span><span>he writes that Earth’s lithosphere is “constantly changing due to the process of plate tectonics and the “process continues today.” She also notes “Earth’s oceans will not keep their familiar shapes forever.” If Earth’s plates are constantly moving, and therefore the oceans are changing shape, I am able to figure out, or infer, that a long time from now, our planet and its seas won’t look the same. </span></p>
		<p>Display a blank graphic organizer like the one in the margin. Write in the inference then ask students to recall the text evidence that directly supports the inference.</p>

		<p><span>Argument prompt.</span> Write a clear, well-organized argument to support the following claim: The ocean’s natural resources for food and energy play a critical role in human survival. Cite evidence from the text to support the claim. Make sure that your argument has a clear introduction and concluding section.</p>
		<p><span>Informative/explanatory prompt.</span> Using the information provided in the text, write a short informational essay comparing and contrasting tides and waves.</p>
		<p><span>Narrative prompt. </span>Using information from the introduction and conclusion, write a fictional narrative about the experiences of one of the floating tub toys that fell into the sea in 1992. Your account should be based on factual information in the text.</p>
		<p>Collaborative Research <span>W.6–6.7, W.6–6.8, W.6–6.9</span></p>
		<p>Have students collaborate to complete the research project outlined on the inside back cover of the text. Use the research project as a context in which to support students’ online research skills and to strengthen students’ presentation skills by requiring them to present their findings formally.</p>
		<p>Closed-Book Content Assessment <span>RST.6.7, RST.6.8</span></p>
		<p>You may wish to have students complete a formal content assessment available in this guide (BLMs 2 and 3) and online. This assessment helps you evaluate students’ understanding of the standards-based concepts developed in the text. More information about the question types and an answer key are also available online. <br />An answer key is provided on page 13 of this guide.</p>
		<p>Answer Key</p>
		<p>Content Assessment</p>
		<p>1. The continents were one huge landmass, or supercontinent, called Pangaea 225 million years ago.</p>
		<p>2. </p>
		<p>3. Sample answer: Plants live in the euphotic zone because it’s the only zone that gets ample sunlight for them to grow. </p>
		<p>4. Sample answer: The gravitational pull from the moon causes most of Earth’s tidal action.</p>
		<p>5. </p>
		<p>6. Sample answer: Both transport heat from low altitudes to high altitudes. </p>
		<p>7. Samples answer: The presence or absence of light, water temperature, and water pressure.</p>
		<p>8. Sample answer: Coral reefs offer food and shelter, attracting many living organisms to live there. Other organism, such as sharks, rays, and turtles visit because there are many organisms to hunt there.</p>
		<p>9. Answers will vary but should include one of the following three sea habitats: Abyssal plains are vast, flat stretches covered in silt and decayed material. Organisms found there include sea urchins, sea stars, crabs, sea cucumbers, and microorganisms. Seamounts are underwater mountains with rocky surfaces. Organisms include lobsters, crabs, sea stars, sea anemones, fish, sharks, whales, and sea turtles. Hydrothermal vents are underwater geysers that spew hot water and chemicals. Organisms that live there include snails, shrimp, crabs, tube worms, shellfish, eels, squid, and octopuses.</p>
		<p>10. Summary: The ocean’s varying conditions along its water column support a range of different sea life, from drifting plankton to the larger nekton, or ocean swimmers. Nekton migrate to different locations during the year, while plankton do a vertical migration. They move up to the sea’s surface at night and sink to the darker, colder regions during the day to avoid predators, sunlight, and other threats to their survival. The ocean’s shallow water has different zones. The intertidal zone, or area between a shore’s high- and low-tide marks, can be sandy, rocky, or muddy. Some organisms live in tidal pools within this zone. A little further offshore in warm, clear waters are coral reefs. They offer food and shelter to many organisms, such as fish, lobster, eels, and more. Deeper waters have other kinds of habitats, such as underwater geysers called hydrothermal vents that attract bacteria, snails, shrimp, crabs, tube worms, shellfish and other scavengers.</p>
