		<p>Read aloud the features of an analytical argument on the inside front cover. Then have students turn to the Table of Contents and read the titles of each section. Invite students to read the book description on the back cover.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Two of the stories in this book are historical fiction. Although the main characters are not real people, the events in these stories are based on true events. The third story is an example of realistic fiction. It is set in the present-day. The characters are made-up, but the situation is something that could happen. After the three stories, there are three argument essays about courage.</p>
		<p>If your students need more support, use the Scaffolded Preview provided.</p>
		<p>Set a Purpose</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Because these stories deal with characters who make difficult decisions that affect themselves and others, let’s pay close attention to how their actions contribute to the sequence of events. As you read “Into the Fire,” use self-stick notes to identify the main characters and setting, and to flag main ideas.</p>
		<p>Choose the reading option that best meets your students’ needs.</p>
		<p>Summarize Main Idea and Key Details: <span>Think and Write Together</span></p>
		<p>Invite students to state the characters, settings, and main events in “Into the Fire.” As a group, create a Story Elements Chart. Then, as a group, construct a summary of “Into the Fire.” If students need more support to summarize the text, use the lesson on page 3 of this guide.</p>

		<p>Reread the first paragraph on page 5.</p>

		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share their inferences about the girls’ relationship and the supporting text evidence.

		<p>Explain that this question is asking them to read a character analysis and then find evidence to support the analysis.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> I need to find evidence that supports the claim that Stephen’s actions were courageous in light of his circumstances. First, I need to think about Stephen’s circumstances.</p>
		<p>Reread the last paragraph on page 24.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> If Stephen turns in his teammates, he is likely to become very unpopular with them. In addition, he is hurting the team’s chance to win the playoffs. That has to be a difficult decision to make because he risks letting the whole team, including people who have not done anything wrong, down.</p>
		<p>Model writing your evidence on a blank Text Evidence Chart.</p>
		<p>Support Practice</p>
		<p>Ask students to turn to page 25.</p>
		<p><span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> Ask students to turn to a partner, reread the last two paragraphs on page 25, and find additional evidence that supports the claim that Stephen’s actions were courageous. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share the text evidence they found and to explain how their evidence supports their inference. Students should be able to explain that Stephen was thinking of his classmate Zachary more than of himself.</p>
		<p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
		<p>Ask students to reread the story “Breaking the Silence.” Tell them to find additional text evidence in the story that helps support the argument writer’s claim that Stephen was courageous. (Staying quiet would be easier for Stephen; Stephen took a lot of heat from his teammates.)</p>
		<p>Discuss how this close reading has helped students use text evidence to make an inference about the speech.</p>
		<p>Close Reading Option 4:<span> Analyze an Argument </span><br /><span>RL.6.1, RL.6.3, W.6.2b, W.6.8, SL.6.1a, SL.6.1b, SL.6.1c, SL.6.1d, SL.6.3</span></p>
		<p>Model Finding Text Evidence</p>
		<p>Ask students to turn to Argument 2,<span> Foolish Decision</span>, on page 26. Explain that a <br />well-written argument states the argument clearly, supports the argument with reasons, uses transition words to connect ideas, and has a concluding statement which restates the argument.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> The first paragraph clearly states the writer’s argument: “Though their actions seem courageous, they risk hurting themselves and others. In each case, the characters could have gotten the same positive results with less risk.” In order to analyze this claim, I will look for reasons and specific text evidence that the author uses to support this argument.</p>
		<p>Distribute the graphic organizer BLM on the back cover of this guide and ask students to write the argument at the top of the chart.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Now I need to find a piece of evidence to support this argument. I’ll begin by rereading the second paragraph to look for evidence. The reason why the writer thinks that although Sofia was brave, she risked not only her life but also Madeline’s, by rushing back to save her instead of finding a firefighter.</p>
		<p>Support students to find the text evidence provided to support this reason: the writer points out that Sofia loses valuable time trying to free Madeline’s foot from the treadle. Have students reread “Into the Fire” to find additional evidence to support the writer’s claim. Add the evidence to the chart.</p>
		<p>Support Practice</p>
		<p><span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> Ask students to turn to a partner, reread the third paragraph on page 26, and find the evidence the writer uses to support the claim that Patricia doesn’t care about her safety or her parents’ concerns. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share their text evidence. Students should refer to the conversation between Patricia and her parents.</p>
		<p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
		<p>Tell students to look for parts of the argument that could be made stronger by providing more text evidence. Ask them to reread all three stories to gather more text evidence and write quotes from the text, indicating where they would insert it in the argument if they were to revise the writing.</p>
		<p>Discuss how this close reading has helped students analyze an opinion text.</p>
		<p>Close Reading Option 5:<span> Answering Text Evidence Questions </span><span><span>RL.6.1, RL.6.2, RL.6.4</span></span></p>
		<p>Use these questions to extend close reading or challenge students who do not need modeling or differentiated practice.</p>
		<p>Draw Inferences</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> What evidence from the text supports the conclusion that the girls in the Lowell textile mill were working in unsafe conditions?</p>
		<p><span>Text Evidence:</span> “Rows of intricate looms stretched the length of the dimly lit <br />room. . . .” “… they began their <br />fourteen-hour workday.” “With all eyes aimed on the lone door …” (p. 6)</p>
		<p>Determine Key Details</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> What details in “Together and Equal” support the idea that integration was necessary to make things equal?</p>
		<p><span>Answer:</span> Mrs. Henderson explains how separate but equal is unfair to the black students.</p>
		<p><span>Text Evidence:</span> “The whole idea of separate but equal is nothing but bunk. Patricia’s school has worn, outdated books, and some of the kids have to sit on the floor because the classrooms are so crowded. Never mind the paint on the walls that’s as old as the hills. And she’s forced to ride the bus clear across town every day to go to the black school when she could walk right down the street to the white school instead.” (p. 11)</p>
		<p>Use Context Clues</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> What examples does the author of “Breaking the Silence” give to help define the word <span>quirky</span>?</p>
		<p><span>Definition:</span> odd or peculiar </p>
		<p><span>Text Evidence:</span> “He was incredibly smart and apparently a golf whiz, but he had a hard time making friends because of his quirky habits and rules.” (p. 17).</p>

		<p><span>Cross-Text Analysis Card</span></p>
		<p>Build Language, Vocabulary, and Comprehension <br /><span>L.6.2a, L.6.5a</span></p>
		<p>Choosing the Correct Punctuation</p>
		<p>Remind students that dashes are used to set parenthetical phrases in sentences apart from the rest of the sentence. They are not the same as commas and should not be treated as such.</p>
		<p>Display the following sentence.</p>
		<p>My foot—it’s stuck.</p>
		<p>Explain that the dash sets the second part of the sentence apart from the first part.</p>
		<p>Display another sentence lacking in parenthetical punctuation.</p>
		<p><span>Oh, all right you do what you have to do.</span></p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Where do you think a dash needs to be placed?</p>
		<p>Write the sentence with the correct placement of the parenthetical punctuation.</p>
		<p><span>Oh, all right—you do what you have to do.</span></p>
		<p>Continue this lesson by having students work in pairs to identify other instances in which dashes are used in this book. Have them circle the parenthetical phrases.</p>
		<p>Interpret Figurative Language</p>
		<p>Have students turn to the vocabulary activity on the inside back cover.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Similes and metaphors are types of figurative language. They both compare things, but similes use the words <span>like</span> or <span>as</span> and metaphors do not. Let’s find examples of similes and metaphors in this book.</p>
		<p>Have students turn to page 17.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> The writer compares the way students leave the school building to a herd of wild horses racing across the Russian Steppes. The writer uses the word <span>as</span> so this is a simile. It means the students were chaotic and full of energy.</p>
		<p>Model how to complete the chart. Then ask students to complete the rest of the chart independently, and to provide their answers in writing.</p>
		<p>Comprehension Across Texts</p>
		<p>If students have read all four texts in the topic set, use the questions on the Cross-Text Analysis Card for additional close readings that require students to find and analyze evidence in more than one text.</p>
		<p>Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening <span>RL.6.1, W.6.1a, W.6.1b, W.6.1c, W.6.1d, W.6.1e, W.6.2a, W.6.2b, W.6.2c, W.6.2d, W.6.2e, W.6.2f, SL.6.2, SL.6.4, L.6.6</span></p>
		<p>Practice Finding Text Evidence</p>
		<p>Have students reread the text to find evidence to answer the questions on the Text Evidence Question Card.</p>
		<p>Write to Sources<span>: </span><span>Analytical Argument</span></p>
		<p>Have students demonstrate their understanding of <span>Analytical Arguments About Courage</span> by responding to the text-dependent writing prompt on the inside back cover. Rubrics to help you evaluate students’ writing are available in the online teacher’s guide.</p>
		<p><span>Analytical Argument.</span> Sofia, Patricia, and Stephen all made important decisions. Write an argument essay to answer this question: which of the three main characters had the strongest motivation for his or her actions? Defend your claim with reason and evidence from the stories.</p>
		<p>Practice Academic Vocabulary</p>
		<p>Ask partners to each choose four words from the glossary and write short sentences to&#160;indicate they understand the definition of the words. Partners should then compose a short paragraph that includes the four words they chose. Have pairs read aloud their&#160;paragraphs.</p>
		<p>Collaborative Research</p>
		<p>Have partners conduct collaborative research on people in history who have made courageous decisions, such as Ruby Bridges or Miep Gies. Have them use print and digital resources. They should take notes on what made the person courageous and then write and publish their report. Remind them to sort evidence and list sources where necessary. As an additional challenge, have them present their reports to the class.</p>
