		<p>Explain that this question is asking them to compare the characters of Bud in the first excerpt and M.C. in the second excerpt to examine their points of view.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> I need to compare how each character’s point of view differs and how that helps me understand the events in the story.</p>
		<p>Reread page 6 with students.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Bud is so determined to find his dad that he does not see walking for twenty-four hours as something too difficult. Instead of being discouraged, he plans when to start and what cities he will pass through. This helps me understand that finding his father is very important to him.</p>
		<p>Model writing your evidence on a blank Text Evidence Chart.</p>
		<p>Support Practice</p>
		<p>Ask students to turn to page 12.</p>
		<p><span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> Ask students to turn to a partner, reread page 12, and find text evidence that shows how the author demonstrates M.C.’s dreamy and relaxed point of view. Point out that he pretends to be old and imagines he has lived on the mountain his whole life.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share the text evidence they found and to explain how their evidence explains M.C.’s point of view about his love for Sarah’s Mountain. Students should be able to explain that he imagines his future in a way that shows he never left the mountain and died there just like his ancestors did.</p>
		<p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
		<p>Ask students to reread page 13. Tell them to find text evidence that helps them show that M.C.’s dreamy and relaxed point of view demonstrates his attachment to the mountain and his desire to save it. Students should realize that he “wakes” from his daydreams to the sounds of machines working on the mountain and fears that the mountain will one day be destroyed.</p>
		<p>Discuss how this close reading has helped students use text evidence to make inferences.</p>
		<p>Close Reading Option 4:<span> Analyze an Opinion Text </span><br /><span>RI.6.1, RI.6.8, </span><span>W.6.1c, W.6.2b, W.6.2c, SL.6.1a, SL.6.1c, Sl.6.1d, SL.6.3</span></p>
		<p>Model Finding Text Evidence</p>
		<p>Ask students to turn to Opinion 2, “Characters Become Observers” on page 22. Explain that a well-written opinion states the opinion clearly, supports the opinion with reasons, uses transition words to connect ideas, and has a concluding statement that restates the opinion.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> The writer’s opinion is clearly stated with this sentence: “In both <span>M.C. Higgins, the Great</span> by Virginia Hamilton and <span>Bud, Not Buddy</span> by Christopher Paul Curtis, the main character is an astute observer who examines and reflects on his world.” In order to analyze this opinion, I will look for specific text evidence the writer uses to support this&#160;opinion.</p>
		<p>Distribute the graphic organizer BLM on the back cover of this guide.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> The writer gives reasons why each character is an astute observer.</p>
		<p>Support students to find text evidence to fill in the chart: M.C. has a special 40-foot pole that he sits on when observing the mountain. From this vantage point, he can see everything around him and acts like a spy.</p>
		<p>Support Practice</p>
		<p><span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> Ask students to turn to a partner, reread pages 6–7, and find the text evidence to show that Bud is a strong character who can think for himself, as well as concentrate and focus on a task. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share their text evidence. Students should point out that Bud’s calculations about his travels and his deep focus on the Civil War book show he is a strong character. In addition, his observations about the librarian show&#160;that he is a keen observer. Tell students that this text evidence supports the writer’s main idea.</p>
		<p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
		<p>Tell students to look for parts of the opinion piece that could be made stronger by providing more text evidence. Ask them to gather text evidence and write quotes from the text, indicating where they would insert it in the opinion piece if they were to revise the writing. Have them focus on text evidence to indicate that both characters are strong</p>
		<p>Discuss how this close reading has helped students analyze an opinion text.</p>
		<p>Close Reading Option 5:<span> Answering Text Evidence Questions </span><span><span>RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.4a</span></span></p>
		<p>Use these questions to extend close reading or challenge students who do not need modeling or differentiated practice.</p>
		<p>Draw Inferences</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> What evidence from the text supports the conclusion that both Bud and M.C. are concerned about their families?</p>
		<p><span>Text Evidence:</span> “By this time tomorrow, I’d be looking at the face of the man who had to be my father.” (p. 8) “At once his father and mother, brothers and sisters sprang to life in his mind.” (p. 13)</p>
		<p>Determine Key Details</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> How are the selections different and similar in their subject matter?</p>
		<p><span>Answer:</span> <span>Bud</span><span>,</span><span> Not Buddy </span>is about a boy trying to find out about his past and the father he never knew. <span>M.C. Higgins, the Great </span>is about a boy concerned about the future of his family’s home environment. Both are about young boys who are concerned about their families.</p>
		<p>Use Context Clues</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> What does <span>vantage point </span>mean on page 23?</p>
		<p><span>Definition:</span> viewpoint</p>
		<p><span>Text Evidence:</span> “. . . he could see everything in spectacular view.” (p. 22)</p>

		<p>Build Language, Vocabulary, and Comprehension <br /><span>RL.6.9, RI.6.9, RF.6.4c, L.6.2c</span></p>
		<p>Use Commas to Set Off Words</p>
		<p>Remind students that commas are used to set off words and phrases from the rest of a sentence.</p>
		<p>Write the following sentence on the board:</p>
		<p><span>“From atop his steel pole, M.C. scrutinizes the hills, the river, and the mountains, noting the people and the events in his world.”</span></p>
		<p>Read the sentence aloud and pause at each comma. Then reread the sentence without the commas and ask students to discuss how each reading of the sentence differed from the other. Explain that commas in a sentence show the reader natural places to pause when reading.</p>
		<p>Continue this lesson by having students work in pairs to identify other instances in the book in which a comma is used to set off words from the rest of a sentence. Have them write these sentences and read them aloud to each other with or without the commas.</p>
		<p>Vocabulary Skill: Using Context Clues</p>
		<p>Have students turn to the vocabulary activity on the inside back cover.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Context clues are words and sentences that come before or after unfamiliar words or phrases that help you understand its meaning. These may include cause-and-effect relationships or comparisons.</p>
		<p>Have students locate the phrase <span>character sketches </span>on page 2.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> The context clues are “One of those sketches became Bud Caldwell—the hero of <span>Bud, Not Buddy</span>” and “…Curtis draws on his own family members and history in his novels.” (p. 2)</p>
		<p>Ask students to write <span>character sketches, </span>the context clues, and the meaning of the phrase in their charts. They should then locate other familiar words in their book and complete the chart.</p>
		<p>Comprehension Across Texts</p>
		<p>If students have read all four texts in the topic set, use the questions on the Cross-Text Analysis Card for additional close readings that require students to find and analyze evidence in more than one text.</p>
		<p>Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening <span>RI</span><span>.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.3, RI.6.4, W.6.1a, W.6.1b, W.6.1c, W.6.1d, W.6.2d, W.6.7, W.6.8, L.6.6</span></p>
		<p>Practice Finding Text Evidence</p>
		<p>Have students reread the text to find evidence to answer the questions on the Text Evidence Question Card.</p>
		<p>Write to Sources: Narrative Writing</p>
		<p>Have students demonstrate their understanding of <span>Opinions About Difficult Times Portrayed in Literature</span> by responding to the text-dependent writing prompt on the inside back cover. Rubrics to help you evaluate students’ writing are available in the online teacher’s guide.</p>
		<p><span>Narrative Writing.</span> Choose one of the chapters and write a new chapter that could come directly after it. Use details from the chapter you read in your new chapter.</p>
		<p>Practice Academic Vocabulary</p>
		<p>Ask partners to choose three domain-specific words from the glossary and compose oral sentences that demonstrate their understanding of the words. Then have students use these words to write a paragraph that incorporates the three words they chose.</p>
		<p>Collaborative Research</p>
		<p>Have partners conduct collaborative research about Christopher Paul Curtis or Virginia Hamilton. These two writers captured what it was like to live through difficult times. Have students use print and digital resources to learn about the life of one of these writers and what inspired their writing. As they do their research, have them take notes, then write, and publish their reports. As an additional challenge, have students present their reports to the class.</p>
