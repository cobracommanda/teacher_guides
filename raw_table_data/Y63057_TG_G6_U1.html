		<p>© Benchmark Education Company, LLC</p>
		<p>Read Chapter 1 <span>RI.6.2, RST.6.2, SL.6.1</span></p>
		<p>Set a Purpose</p>
		<p>If necessary, use the Scaffolded Preview and Cognates for Essential Vocabulary to help students access the text.</p>
		<p>Read aloud the supporting question on page 6: <span>How does climate influence the development of biomes?</span></p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>As you read this chapter, you will use a strategy called Q-Notes to help you understand how climate influences the development of biomes.</span></p>
		<p>Display the Q-Notes sample shown in the right margin.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>The Q-Notes process is a form of note-taking. As you read, write down questions in the left column. You can do this by rewriting the headings, subheadings, and topic sentences as questions. Continue reading to find the answers, and record them in the right column of the Q-Notes chart. Q-Notes help you focus on the most important information in a text.</span></p>
		<p>Read aloud page 10 and model how you use the Q-Notes format.</p>
		<p>Have students create a Q-Notes chart on notebook paper, or distribute copies of BLM 1.</p>
		<p>Show students how you form a question from the topic sentence, <span>How does latitude affect climate? </span> Write the question in the left column of the Q-Notes chart. Then have students read to find the answer. Have them record their answers in the right column, using a short answer, picture, or any form of note-taking that effectively helps them capture the information. Circulate to monitor and provide help as needed. Remind students that asking questions about what they read will help them focus on and summarize the key ideas in each chapter.</p>
		<p>Summarize Key Concepts: Think and Write Together</p>
		<p>Invite students to share their Q-Notes. What questions did they ask in the left column? Do the answers they recorded in the right column provide information needed to understand central ideas/concepts? Provide time for students to share and discuss their chapter summaries with the class.</p>
		<p>Use the Sentence Frames to Support Collaborative Conversation for English learners.</p>
		<p>As a group, construct a two- to three-sentence written summary of the key ideas in the chapter. If students need more support to summarize the text, explicitly model strategies for summarizing.</p>
		<p>Model Summarizing</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>When we summarize, we include only the most important information in a text. We look for the central ideas. We don’t include all of the details. Let’s summarize a section of this chapter together.</span></p>
		<p>Reread page 8.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>This page is about how living things adapt to the climate where they live. I ask myself, “What is the central idea the author wants me to understand about how plants and animals adapt to the climates where they live?”</span></p>
		<p>Allow responses. Support students to recognize that the author wants readers to understand how animals and plants adapt to certain climates. As part of the explanation, the author defines adaptation and she also describes how a climograph is used to show the pattern of temperature and precipitation in one location.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>In my summary, I will focus on the central idea. I will not include a definition of adaptation or describe the purpose of a climograph.</span></p>

						<p><span>Climate affects animal and plant adaptations. In hot climates, some animals stay cool by burrowing underground during the hot day and feeding at night. Plants have adaptations for the heat, too, such as leaf coatings that keep them cool. Organisms also adapt to precipitation. In places with lots of rain, for example, plants have a leaf adaptation in which they release much of the water the roots have absorbed back into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, plants in dry climates store water or have very long roots to reach underground water.</span></p>

						<p><span>Each biome has a community of living organisms adapted to its climate. The tundra is dry and cold with animals and plants adapted to its long winters and harsh wind. The taiga also has dry, cold winters. Its coniferous trees’ needle-shaped leaves shed snow and allow wind to pass through.  In the temperate deciduous forest, trees shed their leaves in autumn and grow new leaves in spring. In the grassland, a whole year’s rain falls within a few weeks. Plants grow quickly during the wet season and rest during the dry period.  In the tropical rain forest’s hot, wet season, which lasts most of the year, trees grow tall and thousands of species live together. The temperate rain forest with its mild, wet winters and cool, foggy summers is home to the largest trees on Earth. Birds, insects, and mammals are adapted to eat the trees’ leaves, seeds, and berries.  Some desert biomes are hot and others are cold, but all are very dry.</span></p>

		<p>Explain that the question asks the reader to find evidence in the text that supports the author’s claim.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span><span> I’m going to show you how I read closely to evaluate an author’s argument or claim. To evaluate the validity of an author’s claim, I need to identify evidence in the text that supports it.</span></p>
		<p>Reread page 13 while students follow along.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span><span> The author provides evidence to support the claim that areas that get winds and weather from the ocean tend to have a mild climate. To support this claim, she gives the example of Juneau, Alaska, which is on the Pacific coast. We learn that Juneau has cool, wet winters while inland areas south of Juneau, such as St. Louis, Missouri, are much colder because they are further from the ocean.</span></p>
		<p>Display a blank graphic organizer like the one in the margin. Write the argument or claim in the left column, and then ask students to recall evidence in the text that directly supports the argument.</p>

		<p>Extend Language Concepts: <span>Imperatives</span> <span>L.6.1</span></p>
		<p><span>Read the following sentence from page 7:</span></p>
		<p><span>“Think of a place that is very hot and dry.”</span></p>
		<p><span>Say:</span>  This sentence is an imperative because it instructs readers to do something.</p>
		<p>Imperative sentences give commands or instructions, and they almost never have a subject because they address the reader directly. In this sentence, the author commands students to “think of a place that is very hot and dry.”   Have students work in pairs to look through the book for additional examples of imperatives. Ask students to share their findings. Monitor and provide feedback as necessary. Record the imperatives on a chart to refer to throughout the rest of the unit.</p>
		<p><span>Turn and talk.</span> Challenge partners to compose sentences with different imperatives based on information in the text. Have partners share their sentences with the rest of the class and explain how the imperatives affect their sentences.</p>
		<p>Extend Language Concepts: <span>Conjunctions (but)</span> <span>L.6.1</span></p>
		<p>Read the following sentences from page 13:</p>
		<p><span>“St. Louis, Missouri is far south of Juneau but has colder winters.”</span></p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> A conjunction is a word that connects two ideas. The word <span>but</span> is a conjunction that shows opposite or contrasting ideas. In this sentence, for example, the conjunction <span>but</span> contrasts the climate of St. Louis, Missouri and Juneau, Alaska.</p>
		<p>Read the following sentence from page 24:</p>
		<p><span>“Estivation is similar to hibernation, but it occurs in the summer.”</span></p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> In this sentence, the conjunction <span>but</span> contrasts estivation and hibernation.</p>
		<p>Have students work in pairs to find more examples of the conjunction <span>but </span>as it’s used to contrast. Have them list the sentences in which the conjunction is used. As students share their findings, record them on chart paper under the title “Examples of Conjunctions.”</p>

		<p>Practice Finding Text Evidence</p>
		<p>Have students work independently or with a partner to answer questions that require them to find evidence in the text using the Text Evidence Question Card for <br />this book.</p>
		<p>Writing to Sources</p>
		<p>Use one of the text-dependent writing prompts below, or create one of your own, to give students the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the concepts covered in the text. Rubrics to help you evaluate students’ writing are available in the Digital Teacher’s Guide (BenchmarkUniverse.com).</p>
		<p><span>Argument prompt.</span> Imagine you are running for political office in your town. One of the big issues facing your community is air pollution caused by a local factory that is also the employer of many of your neighbors. Write a speech persuading the factory owner to make conservational efforts to reduce the damage the factory is causing, using examples from the book to support your argument.  Make sure that your argument has a clear introduction and concluding section.</p>
		<p><span>Informative/explanatory prompt.</span> Write an essay comparing and contrasting two or more biomes. Use compare and contrast signal words in your essay.</p>
		<p><span>Narrative prompt. </span> Imagine you are the farmer in the African grassland with the failed crop, who is deciding whether or not to sell elephant tusks in order to feed his family. You are a humane person, who cares about animals, but you also don’t want your family to starve. Describe your struggle in a diary entry.</p>
		<p>Collaborative Research</p>
		<p>Have students collaborate to complete the research project outlined on the inside back cover of the text. Use the research project as a context in which to support students’ online research skills and to strengthen students’ presentation skills by requiring them to present their findings formally.</p>
		<p>Closed-Book Content Assessment</p>
		<p>You may wish to have students complete a formal content assessment available in this guide (BLMs 2 and 3) and online. This assessment helps you evaluate students’ understanding of the standards-based concepts developed in the text. More information about the question types and an answer key are also available online. An answer key is provided on page 13 of this guide.</p>
