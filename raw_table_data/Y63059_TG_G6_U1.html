		<p>Summarize Key Concepts: <span>Think and Write Together</span></p>
		<p>Invite students to share their Double Entry Journals. What central ideas and key concepts did they list in the second column?

Support students to understand that the author wants readers to understand that cells are made up of different parts called organelles and that each organelle has a specific job to do, or function.

		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>I will need to look for signal words that show a chronology, or order of events, or a sequence of steps in a process.</span></p>
		<p>Reread page 12.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> In this section the author begins by explaining why cells divide. Then she describes the process, explaining that cells copy themselves by dividing into two parts. The word <span>before</span> at the beginning of the third sentence is a signal word that tells me something happens before the cells divide. When I read on, I learn that first the cell must replicate its DNA within the cell. This is confirmed later in the text when the author explains that cell division starts with every chromosome making a copy of itself. Recognizing sequential text will help me understand this and many other life processes described in this book. </p>

		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>This text uses words and phrases specific to the study of living organisms. Some are defined in context, but others are not.

		<p>Use one of the text-dependent writing prompts below, or create one of your own, to give students the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the concepts covered in the text. Rubrics to help you evaluate students’ writing are available in the Digital Teacher’s Guide (BenchmarkUniverse.com).</p>
		<p><span>Argument prompt.</span> Write a clear, well-organized argument to support the following claim: Living organisms all carry out the same essential processes in order to sustain life. Provide at least three reasons to support the claim, and cite evidence from the text to support each reason. Make sure that your argument has a clear introduction and concluding section.</p>
		<p><span>Informative/explanatory prompt.</span> Using the information provided in the text, write a short procedural text that explains the stages of one of the processes that living things carry out in order to grow and survive. </p>
		<p><span>Narrative prompt. </span>Using the introduction and conclusion as a model, write a fictional narrative about the experiences of a colony of moon jellyfish. Your account should be based on factual information in the text.</p>
		<p>Collaborative Research <span>W.6–6.7, W.6–6.8, W.6–6.9</span></p>
		<p>Have students collaborate to complete the research project outlined on the inside back cover of the text. Use the research project as a context in which to support students’ online research skills and to strengthen students’ presentation skills by requiring them to present their findings formally.</p>
		<p>Closed-Book Content Assessment <span>RST.6–6.7, RST.6–6.8</span></p>
		<p>You may wish to have students complete a formal content assessment available in this guide (BLMs 2 and 3) and online. This assessment helps you evaluate students’ understanding of the standards-based concepts developed in the text. More information about the question types and an answer key are also available online. <br />An answer key is provided on page 13 of this guide.</p>
		<p>Answer Key</p>
		<p>Content Assessment</p>
		<p>1. Sample answers: make copies of their cells; replicate their cells; undergo cell division</p>
		<p>2. </p>
		<p>3. Sample answer: A protein is a molecule made up of amino acids. Cells use proteins to carry out different functions, such as to repair or divide themselves, transport materials through the cell, trigger chemical reactions, or fight off disease. Life would not be possible without proteins.</p>
		<p>4. A correct answer will include three of the following: response to stimuli; ingestion, or taking in food and gases to meet their needs; growth; maintaining homeostasis; reproduction; passing on genes to offspring; adaptation.</p>
		<p>5. Sample answer: Plants take in the carbon dioxide that animals produce to manufacture high-energy compounds called carbohydrates. They do this by chemically combining carbon dioxide with water and solar energy in a process called photosynthesis. A by-product of photosynthesis is oxygen, which is used by the animals and plants in respiration. </p>
		<p>6. Answers will vary.</p>
		<p>7. A correct answer will include three of the following: mutations; genetic drift; gene flow; natural selection.</p>
		<p>8. Sample answer: Food chains are too simple to describe what happens in most ecosystems, which are complex communities that support countless species. A food web shows how food chains interact and how energy flows.</p>
		<p>9. Answers should include three of the following: conserve resources; reduce garbage and pollution; use renewable resources; recycle; outlaw overhunting and overfishing; establish nature preserves to protect the environment and endangered species; educate people about the importance of biodiversity.</p>
		<p>10. Summary: The biosphere includes all of the living things on Earth. All living organisms are made up of cells and carry out certain life-sustaining processes. These processes include growth, reproduction, and maintaining homeostasis. Plants and animals are made up of complex eukaryotic cells, while simpler organisms, such as bacteria, are made up of prokaryotic cells. Cells all have specific functions and include different organelles, which are made up of proteins, which also have specific functions. The nucleus is the control center of the cell and contains DNA, which is copied and passed on during cell division and reproduction. Organisms in an ecosystem inherit certain traits and adaptations that enable them to survive in their environment. These characteristics allow for diversity in an ecosystem. Each ecosystem includes complex communities of organisms that have certain roles. Producers, such as plants, use the process of photosynthesis to make their own food. Consumers eat producers and other consumers. Decomposers eat waste and dead organisms. </p>
