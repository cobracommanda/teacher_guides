		<p>Remind students that the theme of a story is a central message. Explain that this question asks readers to identify a theme in the play and then locate text evidence that illustrates it.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Finding the theme of a story requires readers to make an inference based on text evidence. We need to look at the characters’ actions and how they affect the plot of <br />the story.</p>
		<p>Reread pages 10–11.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> In the courtroom scene, I notice that Mr. Brownlow shows kindness towards Oliver. When the judge sentences Oliver to three months of hard labor, Mr. Brownlow says, “I’ve decided that I’m not pressing any charges. This boy is very ill.” Mr. Brownlow takes Oliver home and takes care of him. This act of kindness dramatically changes the course of Oliver’s life in a positive way. Instead of going to prison, he has a home where he is cared for. I think a central theme of the play is the importance of showing kindness to others.</p>

Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share the text evidence they found. Students should be able to explain that Nancy shows kindness by trying to help <br />Oliver&#160;and telling Rose the truth about him. Her actions will result in Oliver returning to Mr. Brownlow’s home rather than being handed over to the police. This shows how kindness can have an important and positive effect on someone’s life.</p>
		<p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
		<p>Ask students to reread pages 29–30 independently to identify more evidence that supports the theme. Students should conclude that Mr. Brownlow shows kindness to Oliver by demanding that Monks share the family inheritance and by giving Oliver a new life and a new home.</p>

		<p>Explain that a turning point is an event in the story that can change the main character’s life–and the direction of the plot—in a significant way. Explain that this question asks readers to find text evidence that helps them draw an inference about what makes Act Two, Scene Four a turning point in the story.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> First, I will need to look at what happens to Oliver and what happens in the plot up until this point in the story. Then I will need to find text evidence that helps me understand what event in Act Two, Scene Four could significantly change Oliver’s life.</p>
		<p>Review with students the key events in Act One.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> In Act One, Oliver’s life has some ups and downs. In Scenes One and Two, he is arrested as a pickpocket and faces three months of hard labor. In Scene Three, we see that Oliver’s life has greatly improved. He has a home and he is being taken care of. Mr. Brownlow says that Oliver will “recuperate nicely.” In Scene Four, it says that Oliver is “looking well in a new suit of clothes.” This text evidence tells me that his life is moving ahead in a healthy and positive direction.</p>
		<p>Record the evidence on a blank Text Evidence Chart.</p>
		<p>Support Practice</p>
		<p>Ask students to turn to page 15.</p>
		<p><span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span><span> </span>Ask students to turn to a partner. Ask them to reread the first three scenes of Act Two, and to find text evidence that helps them draw inferences about Oliver’s life. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and invite pairs to share the text evidence they found. Students should be able to explain that Oliver’s life has taken a downward turn again because he is back in the control of the criminals Fagin and Sikes. Students should also note that Oliver is in danger of being killed or arrested again because Monks does not want him to be able to claim any of his family’s money.</p>
		<p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
		<p>Ask students to reread Act Three, Scene Four independently. Tell them to look for text evidence that helps them draw an inference about what makes this scene the turning point in the play. Students should be able to explain that Oliver’s life could change significantly in a bad way because both Sikes and Crackit threaten to shoot and kill him, and Oliver refuses to break into the house and rob it.</p>
		<p>Discuss how this close reading has helped students draw an inference that Act Two, Scene Four is a turning point in the play because it involves an event that could change Oliver’s life and the story’s plot in a significant and negative way.</p>

		<p>Explain that this question asks readers to find text evidence that helps them draw a conclusion about how Oliver is related to Monks.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> I will need to look for text evidence that will help me draw a conclusion about how Oliver and Monks are connected as members of the same family.</p>
		<p>Reread page 11.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> On page 11, Mr. Brownlow looks at a picture and says, “What I find remarkable is how much the boy looks like the painting of my old friend Edwin Leeford, bequeathed to me before he died.” I know that Oliver is an orphan and does not know anything about his family. This text evidence does not tell me about Monks, but it seems like it could be a evidence about the boy’s background and family. I will look for other text evidence about Oliver’s family and this man named Edwin Leeford.</p>
		<p>Record the evidence on a blank Text Evidence Chart.</p>
		<p>Support Practice</p>
		<p>Ask students to turn to page 21.</p>
		<p><span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> Ask students to turn to a partner, reread page 21, and find text evidence that helps them draw a conclusion about the connection between Oliver and Monks. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share the text evidence they found and to explain how their evidence supports their conclusion. Students should be able to explain that Monks wants Oliver arrested or killed so he cannot “claim any of the family money.” This evidence is important because it shows that Monks is aware that Oliver is related to him in some way. Students may conclude that Monks and Oliver share a parent because they are both due to inherit family money, and that happens when a parent dies.</p>
		<p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
		<p>Ask students to reread pages 28–29 independently. Tell them to find text evidence that helps them draw a conclusion about Oliver’s relationship to Monks. Students should explain that Mr. Brownlow refers to Monks as the son of Edwin Leeford, the person in the painting whom Oliver resembles, and then identifies Oliver as Monks’ half-brother. This is important because it shows that Oliver and Monks have the same father, Edwin Leeford.</p>
		<p>Discuss how this close reading has helped students use text evidence to draw a conclusion about a key relationship between two characters in the play.</p>
		<p>Close Reading Option 4:<span> Analyze Character </span><br /><span>RL.6.1, RL.6.2, RL.6.3, W.6.10, SL.6.1</span></p>
		<p>Model Finding Text Evidence</p>
		<p>Ask students to turn to the Comprehension chart on page 32. Explain that the chart serves to help students analyze a character in the play.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> First, let’s list Mr. Brownlow as the character at the top of the chart. Throughout the play, one characteristic that I noticed about Mr. Brownlow was how kind he was. I will write “kind” in the first row under the heading “Characteristics.”</p>
		<p>Distribute the graphic organizer BLM on the back cover of this guide. Then support students to turn to page 10.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Now I need to find text evidence that shows Mr. Brownlow is a kind man. On page&#160;10, Mr. Brownlow tells the judge, “I’ve decided that I’m <span>not</span> pressing any charges.” Instead of having Oliver arrested and sentenced to three months of hard labor, Mr. Brownlow decides to take Oliver home and care for him. This text evidence tells me that Mr. Brownlow is a kind person.</p>
		<p>Write “drops charges and takes Oliver home” in the first row of the chart. Have students reread page 11 to find additional text evidence of Mr. Brownlow’s kind nature: <span>“Yes, he should recuperate nicely under our watch.” </span>Explain that Mr. Brownlow is showing kindness by giving Oliver a home and helping him become healthy. Add this evidence to the chart.</p>
		<p>Support Practice</p>
		<p><span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> As a group, identify a second characteristic of Mr. Brownlow, such as compassionate, and write it in the second row of the chart. Then ask students to turn to a partner and find text evidence of Mr. Brownlow’s compassion. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share the text evidence they found to show that Mr. Brownlow is compassionate. Students should explain that Mr. Brownlow saves Oliver from prison, gives him a home, and helps him claim his inheritance. Students should also explain that these acts are evidence of Mr. Brownlow’s compassion because they show his willingness to help someone who has no friends, family, or resources.</p>
		<p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
		<p>Direct students to complete the last row of the chart independently. Tell them they should list a third characteristic and then find text evidence that supports it. Students may note that Mr. Brownlow is a fair man because he orders Monks to leave the country but allows him to keep half of his family inheritance.</p>
		<p>Discuss how this close reading has helped students analyze a main character by identifying his key characteristics and then using text evidence to illustrate those characteristics.</p>
		<p>Close Reading Option 5:<span> Answering Text Evidence Questions </span><span><span>RL.6.1, RL.6.2, RL.6.4</span></span></p>
		<p>Use these questions to extend close reading or challenge students who do not need modeling or differentiated practice.</p>
		<p>Draw Inferences</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> Why doesn’t anyone step in to help Oliver when Nancy kidnaps him off the street?</p>
		<p><span>Answer:</span> Nancy pretends that she is Oliver’s governess. She makes it seem as if he stole the books and ran away from home. The people on the street think she is taking him home.</p>
		<p><span>Text Evidence:</span> “Oliver! You naughty boy! Running away from home like. . . . You rascal! Cooperate!” (p. 17)</p>
		<p>Determine Key Details</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> What task does Mr. Brownlow give Oliver?</p>
		<p><span>Answer:</span> He asks Oliver to return some books to the bookstall and give the owner a large sum of money. (p. 13)</p>
		<p>Use Context Clues</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> Reread the stage directions at the top of page 18. What does the term <span>scuffle</span> mean? What evidence on pages 17 and 18 help the reader define the word?</p>
		<p><span>Definition:</span> a fight or struggle between people</p>
		<p><span>Text Evidence:</span> “She creeps behind him, then captures him in the sheet.” (p. 17) <br />“. . . OLIVER manages to peek his head out of the sheet, though NANCY does have a good hold on him.” (p. 18)</p>

		<p>Recognize and Correct Inappropriate Pronoun Usage</p>
		<p>Remind students that pronouns must agree in number and person with the nouns they refer back to.</p>
		<p>Display the following sentences and identify the pronouns:</p>
		<p>I<span> believe </span>you,<span> Nancy. Let </span>us<span> give </span>them<span> some money.</span></p>
		<p>Explain that in the second sentence, <span>us</span> is not correct because it does not agree with<span> I</span> in the first sentence and <span>them</span> is not correct because it does not agree with <span>Nancy </span>in the first sentence. Model how to correct these errors.</p>
		<p>Continue this lesson by having students identify and correct the pronouns that are used inappropriately in these sentences:</p>
		<p><span>The pickpockets stood behind Mr. Brownlow. I tried to take his watch without them noticing.</span></p>
		<p>Vocabulary Strategies: Analyze Figurative Language</p>
		<p>Have students turn to the vocabulary activity on the inside back cover.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Sometimes authors use language in a way that is different from the common meaning. We can use context clues in the surrounding text to help us determine the meaning of figurative language.</p>
		<p>Have students locate the first example on page 21.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Here Monks is referring to Oliver and saying “he can’t squeal without going to jail himself.” He says that Oliver could be “guilty of a crime” and go to jail. In this example, Monks seems to be worried about Oliver saying something that could get him in trouble. I think when Monks says Oliver can’t squeal he means that Oliver can’t tell the police about the criminal activity he has seen.</p>
		<p>Ask students to complete the rest of the chart independently, and to provide their answers in writing.</p>
		<p>Comprehension Across Texts</p>
		<p>If students have read all four texts in the topic set, use the questions on the Cross-Text Analysis Card for additional close readings that require students to find and analyze evidence in more than one text.</p>
		<p>Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening <span>RL.6.4, RL.6.9, RI.6.9, </span><span>W.6.3a, W.6.3b, W.6.3c, W.6.3d, W.6.3e, W.6.7, W.6.8, W.6.9, W.6.10, SL.6.6, L.6.6</span></p>
		<p>Practice Finding Text Evidence</p>
		<p>Have students reread the text to find evidence to answer the questions on the Text Evidence Question Card.</p>
		<p><span>Write to Sources: Narrative</span></p>
		<p>Have students demonstrate their understanding of <span>Oliver Twist: A Dramatization</span> by responding to the text-dependent writing prompt on the inside back cover. Rubrics to help you evaluate students’ writing are available in the online teacher’s guide.</p>
		<p><span>Narrative.</span> Rewrite an act from the play as a narrative from Oliver’s point of view. Use precise words and sensory details in your retelling. Remember to use details from the play in your narrative.</p>
		<p>Practice Academic Vocabulary</p>
		<p>Ask partners to each choose three words from the glossary and compose a short paragraph that includes all three words. Have pairs read aloud their paragraphs.</p>
		<p>Point out that many words can have positive or negative connotations. Have students use digital or print resources to find synonyms for the glossary words <span>hooligans</span> and <span>scamp</span> that have more positive connotations<span>.</span> Have them write sentence pairs that include the glossary word in the first sentence and its synonym in the second sentence. Remind them that the words they use in each sentence should work together to convey either a positive or a negative feeling.</p>
		<p>Collaborative Research</p>
		<p>Have partners conduct collaborative research on the topic of Charles Dickens. Have them use print and digital resources to explore his most famous novels and what he was best known for as an author. Have them take notes on their findings and then write and publish their reports. As an additional challenge, have students present their reports to the&#160;class.</p>
