		<p>Remind students that Rodrigo’s actions in the story are fueled by his love for Abuelo at first. Events in the story help Rodrigo to see the benefit of having a therapy dog program at the rehabilitation center.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> In order to figure out why Rodrigo wanted to do something for all of the residents, we need to first look back at the beginning of the story when Rodrigo goes to visit Abuelo.</p>
		<p>Reread pages 4–6.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Rodrigo notices a melancholy look spread across Abuelo’s face when he thinks of his past and how Santo is all he has left of it. We can infer that Rodrigo realizes Santo is Abuelo’s connection to that past. He knows that Abuelo misses his dog, but he also begins to see that others at the center miss their own dogs in similar ways.</p>

		<p><span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> Ask students to turn to a partner, reread pages 7–8, and find additional text evidence that helps explain why Rodrigo wanted to ensure that the residents could benefit from the therapy dogs. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share the text evidence they found and to explain how their evidence helps them analyze Rodrigo’s motivations. Students should be able to explain that Rodrigo understands the residents are lonely without their dogs. Rodrigo’s mom points out that Abuelo will be reunited with Santo, but the others will not be as fortunate.</p>
		<p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
		<p>Ask students to reread pages 26–27 independently to identify more evidence that supports their analysis of Rodrigo. Students should conclude that “a beaming Rodrigo” feels happy and proud for bringing joy to the residents and making their lives less lonely.</p>
		<p>Discuss how this close reading has helped students understand that the text evidence supports the analysis that Rodrigo is motivated by a desire to help the residents feel less lonely without their dogs at the center.</p>

		<p>Explain that identifying a lesson learned in the text is another way of identifying a theme in the text. When the main character learns something important from his experience, this is a message for readers as well. So, the question is asking what some of the themes in the text are as they relate to Rodrigo’s experience.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Let’s scan the chapters starting at the beginning of the story to see where Rodrigo learns his first lesson.</p>
		<p>Review with students the key events in Chapters 1 and 2.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> On pages 11–12 in Chapter 2, we see that Rodrigo hits his first stumbling block in making his plan work. He finds that it is not easy to train Santo to be a therapy dog.</p>
		<p>Direct students to page 15.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> This idea is reinforced here in Chapter 3 as Rodrigo continues to have difficulty training Santo and finding money for the program at the center. We can infer that he begins to learn the lesson that he will have to work hard to achieve his goal.</p>
		<p>Record the evidence on a blank Text Evidence Chart.</p>
		<p>Support Practice</p>
		<p>Ask students to turn to Chapter 5.</p>
		<p><span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> Ask students to turn to a partner. Have them scan the text to look for another lesson that Rodrigo learns from his experience. Ask them to review the details in Chapter 5. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and invite pairs to share the text evidence they found. Students should be able to explain that Rodrigo learns that he can accomplish more if others help him. This theme is shown through the help and support of Mrs. Brown and others at the therapy center to have a successful rummage sale, and even the help of a reporter to get the word out to others so that the center can make more money.</p>
		<p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
		<p>Ask students to reread Chapter 7 of the story. Tell them to look for text evidence that reveals another lesson that Rodrigo learns in the story. (Students should be able to explain that Rodrigo learns that kind acts can have an effect that is much greater than expected. This is shown through the positive reactions that the residents of the center have to the therapy dog program.)</p>
		<p>Discuss how this close reading has helped students understand that Rodrigo has learned multiple lessons from his experience: he must work hard to achieve his goal; he can accomplish more if others help him; and his kind acts can have far-reaching effects.</p>

		<p>Explain that this question asks readers to find text evidence that helps them draw an inference about why certain events are included in the text.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> I will need to look for text evidence that will help me draw an inference about why the author included Chapter 6 in the story.</p>
		<p>Reread page 25.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> I see that Chapter 6 begins with Rodrigo and Santo at the rehabilitation center. This is the moment that Rodrigo has been working toward throughout the story. It is the reason why he trained Santo to be a therapy dog and why he had a rummage sale to raise money for the center’s therapy dog program. Because of these reasons, Chapter 6 includes the most important event in the story. This is why the author included it.</p>
		<p>Model writing your evidence on a blank Text Evidence Chart.</p>
		<p>Support Practice</p>
		<p>Ask students to turn to page 27.</p>
		<p><span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> Ask students to turn to a partner, reread page 27, and find text evidence about Rodrigo’s reaction that supports the inference that Chapter 6 includes the most important event in the story. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share the text evidence they found and to explain how their evidence supports their conclusion. Students should be able to explain that Rodrigo is beaming when he hugs his grandfather, suggesting he is proud of what he was able to accomplish. This evidence supports the importance of the event.</p>
		<p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
		<p>Ask students to independently reread the interaction between Abuelo and Santo at the bottom of page 27. Tell them to find text evidence that helps them support the inference that Chapter 6 contains the most important event in the story. Students should explain that the reunion between Abuelo and Santo symbolizes what Rodrigo hoped to achieve for everyone at the center by starting a therapy dog program.</p>
		<p>Discuss how this close reading has helped students use text evidence to draw an inference about why the author included Chapter 6 in the story.</p>
		<p>Close Reading Option 4:<span> Analyze Story Elements </span><br /><span>RL.6.1, RL.6.2, RL.6.3, W.6.10, SL.6.1a, SL.6.1b, SL.6.1c, SL.6.1d</span></p>
		<p>Model Finding Text Evidence</p>
		<p>Ask students to turn to the Comprehension chart on page 32. Explain that the chart serves to help students analyze Rodrigo in the story.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> First, let’s list Rodrigo as the character at the top of the chart. Throughout the story, one characteristic that I noticed about Rodrigo was that he was thoughtful. I will write the adjective <span>thoughtful</span> in the first row under the heading “Adjective.”</p>
		<p>Distribute the graphic organizer BLM on the back cover of this guide. Then support students to turn to page 8.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Now I need to find text evidence that shows Rodrigo is thoughtful. On page 8, Rodrigo tells his mother, “Well, I have an idea how we might be able to make the residents less lonely.” Rodrigo wants to do something to help the residents at the rehabilitation center, suggesting that he is both kind and thoughtful.</p>
		<p>Write “wants to help the residents so that they feel less lonely” in the first row of the chart under the heading “Example.”</p>
		<p>Support Practice</p>
		<p><span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> As a group, identify a second characteristic of Rodrigo, such as hard-working, and write it in the second row of the chart under <span>Adjective</span>. Then ask students to turn to a partner and find text evidence of Rodrigo’s willingness to work. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share the text evidence they found to show that Rodrigo is hardworking. Students should explain that Rodrigo works hard to train Santo to become a therapy dog, as shown through numerous details in the text. Students should also explain that these acts are evidence of Rodrigo’s willingness to work&#160;hard.</p>
		<p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
		<p>Direct students to complete the last row of the chart independently. Tell them they should list a third characteristic and then find text evidence that supports it. (<span>Students may note that Rodrigo is generous because he spends a lot of time and effort to do something for others.)</span></p>
		<p>Discuss how this close reading has helped students analyze a main character by identifying his key characteristics and then using text evidence to illustrate those characteristics.</p>
		<p>Close Reading Option 5:<span> Answering Text Evidence Questions </span><span><span>RL.6.1, RL.6.2, RL.6.4</span></span></p>
		<p>Use these questions to extend close reading or challenge students who do not need modeling or differentiated practice.</p>
		<p>Draw Inferences</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> What type of relationship does Rodrigo have with his grandfather?</p>
		<p><span>Answer:</span> Rodrigo has a close bond with his grandfather.</p>
		<p><span>Text Evidence:</span> Rodrigo visits his grandfather every Saturday while he is in the rehabilitation center. (p. 3), and he works hard to make sure that Santo can visit his grandfather in the center. At the end of the story, Rodrigo’s grandfather gives him a big hug when he learns what Rodrigo has done. (p. 27)</p>
		<p>Determine Key Details</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> What does the reporter Rebecca Cassidy tell Rodrigo at the very end of the story?</p>
		<p><span>Answer:</span> His therapy dog program has made a significant difference in her mother’s life and in the lives of those who come to see her mother at the center. (pp. 29–30)</p>
		<p>Use Context Clues</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> Reread the text on <br />pages&#160;20–22. What does the word <span>distraction</span> mean? What evidence in the surrounding paragraphs help the reader define the word?</p>
		<p><span>Definition:</span> something that takes your attention away </p>
		<p><span>Text Evidence:</span> “Rodrigo had to walk Santo, have him sit, lie down, get back up, and walk again, all while things were going on around him . . .” (p. 20); “the loud crash of a metal pan” (p. 21); “He was such a friendly dog that he had a difficult time ignoring people who wanted to play with him.” (p. 22)</p>

		<p><span>Cross-Text Analysis Card</span></p>
		<p>Build Language, Vocabulary, and Comprehension <br /><span>L.6.1d, L.6.5a</span></p>
		<p>Recognize and Correct Vague Pronouns</p>
		<p>Remind students that a pronoun must clearly refer to a specific antecedent in a sentence.</p>
		<p>Display the following sentence:</p>
		<p>Mom<span> took </span>her<span> dog to the groomer, and Aunt Lucy went along, too.</span></p>
		<p>Explain that in this sentence, it is clear that the pronoun <span>her </span>refers to Mom, and not Aunt Lucy. Tell students that it is important to be clear about which pronoun refers to which antecedent in a sentence. Display this sentence:</p>
		<p>Mom<span> and </span>Aunt Lucy<span> took </span>her<span> dog to the groomer.</span></p>
		<p>The vague pronoun can be corrected by clarifying the antecedent.</p>
		<p>Continue this lesson by having students identify and correct the vague pronouns in these sentences:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Rodrigo<span> told </span>Mr. Thompson<span> that </span>his<span> dog was at the center.</span></li>
			<li>The therapy center<span> and </span>the rehabilitation center<span> were close to each other, so Rodrigo visited </span>it<span> often.</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Vocabulary Strategies: <span>Interpret Personification</span></p>
		<p>Have students turn to the vocabulary activity on the inside back cover.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Personification is a literary technique in which nonhuman things are given human characteristics. The author gives Santo human characteristics a few times in the story. Let’s identify these instances.</p>
		<p>Have students locate the first example on page 18.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Here Santo wags his tail in agreement to something that Rodrigo says, but a human would agree with Rodrigo, not a dog. This is a good example of personification.</p>
		<p>Ask students to complete the chart independently with another example of personification. Then ask students why they think the author chose to make Santo seem to understand humans and show human-like traits. Have students respond in writing.</p>
		<p>Comprehension Across Texts</p>
		<p>If students have read all four texts in the topic set, use the questions on the Cross-Text Analysis Card for additional close readings that require students to find and analyze evidence in more than one text.</p>
		<p>Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening <span>RL.6.4, RL.6.9, W.6.3a, </span><span>W.6.3b, W.6.3c, W.6.3d, W.6.3e, W.6.7, W.6.8, W.6.10, SL.6.6, L.6.6</span></p>
		<p>Practice Finding Text Evidence</p>
		<p>Have students reread the text to find evidence to answer the questions on the Text Evidence Question Card.</p>
		<p>Write to Sources<span>: </span>Narrative</p>
		<p>Have students demonstrate their understanding of <span>Rodrigo’s Dogs</span> by responding to the text-dependent writing prompt on the inside back cover. Rubrics to help you evaluate students’ writing are available in the online teacher’s guide.</p>
		<p><span>Narrative.</span> Imagine you are one of the residents at the rehabilitation center. Write a letter to Rodrigo telling him what you think about the therapy dog program, and how it has helped you.</p>
		<p>Practice Academic Vocabulary</p>
		<p>Review the words with students and have volunteers use the words in oral sentence. Ask partners to choose any three words from the glossary and compose a paragraph that describes something that happens in the story.</p>
		<p>Then have students use digital or print resources to search for synonyms or antonyms for the glossary words they used. Ask them to share their findings with the rest of the group.</p>
		<p>Collaborative Research <span>W.6.7, W.6.8, W.6.10</span></p>
		<p>Have partners conduct collaborative research on the benefits of therapy dogs in hospital environments. Have them use print and digital resources to explore how therapy dogs improve the quality of life of patients. Have partners take notes on their findings and then write and publish their reports. As an additional challenge, have students present their reports to the class.</p>
