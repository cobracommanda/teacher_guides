		<p><span>Pages 8–9:</span> <span>This science fiction story has some imaginative beings called “Plynchins.” Plynchins can listen to thoughts, have hair that is always moving, and have a self-contained ecosystem, which means they can live anywhere. Look at our main character, Varuna, on page 8. The story also has creatures and planetary bodies that speak. Look at the illustration on page 8. What will help Varuna? It’s an Onglantichi, a popular toy among teenagers.</span></p>
		<p><span>Page 10:</span> <span>Varuna starts a new job with the census and has to count all beings. Let’s find the word bouillon. Bouillon is in bold print so we can look it up in the glossary. (Do so.) Now find the word bouillon and look it up in the glossary. What does “from primordial bouillon to population bouillon” mean?</span></p>

		<p>Display and read aloud the close reading question: <span>How does the author use dialogue to develop Gphimpy’s character throughout the story?</span>  </p>
		<p>Explain that the question asks readers to find evidence that will tell about Gphimpy’s character traits and how they change. First, you need to find the place in the text where Gphimpy is introduced and see what his character is like in the beginning of the story. </p>
		<p><span><span>Say:</span></span> First I will read the dialogue on page 10. </p>
		<p>Reread page 10. </p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> Gphimpy says “You’d better get cracking,” and he also tells Varuna that she has just wasted 1.7 seconds. This tells me that he is a demanding boss and not in a very good mood. The author’s use of the word “barks” also tells me that he says this in a harsh tone, so I can tell that he is grumpy.</p>

		<p>Ask students to turn to a partner, read the first paragraph on page 15, and read Gphimpy’s dialogue. Tell students to think about how Gphimpy sounds in this part of the story, and compare it to how he talks in the beginning of the story. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share the text evidence they found and describe how it helps them understand Gphimpy’s character. Students should be able to explain that the author uses dialogue to show that Gphimpy has become more pleasant and is happy with Varuna’s work. </p>
		<p><span>Find Text Evidence Independently</span></p>
		<p>Ask students to reread page 19 and page 27 independently and locate evidence to show how the author uses dialogue to show that Ace has changed over the course of the story. (First Ace sounds unsure of himself and doesn’t have a lot of confidence. At the end of the story Ace is showing off to the other kids about his own heroic adventure.) </p>

		<p>Display and read aloud the close reading prompt: <span>Identify details that convey a theme on page 19 of</span> An Attack on the Starship <span>Mayflower</span> in the Year 2647.  </p>
		<p>Explain that this question asks readers to find text evidence that suggests the central idea that readers can find in the story.</p>
		<p><span><span>Say:</span></span><span> First I want to find details about Ace’s character that I recall from the beginning of the story.</span></p>
		<p>Reread the first paragraph on page 19.</p>
		<p><span><span>Say:</span></span><span> This says that Ace feels that he can’t live up to his sister’s and father’s heroic achievements.  </span></p>
		<p>Record the evidence on a blank graphic organizer.</p>
		<p><span>Support Practice</span></p>
		<p>Ask students to turn to a partner, reread page 21, and identify details that convey a theme of <span>An Attack on the Starship </span>Mayflower<span> in the Year 2647</span>. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.</p>
		<p>Bring students together to share their supporting text evidence and their ideas about the theme of the legend. Students should be able to explain that Captain Hank Trace also has complicated feelings about how he relates to his family. He works hard and knows his job is important, but he also wishes that he could spend more time with his children.</p>
		<p><span>Find Text Evidence Independently</span></p>
		<p>Ask students to reread the dialogue between Captain Trace and Helvetica on pages 21 and 22 independently and identify text evidence that helps them confirm or revise their ideas about the theme of <span>An Attack on the Starship </span>Mayflower<span> in the Year 2647</span>. (They are arguing, but Captain Trace is not really angry with his daughter. He wants her to be safe, but he is also proud of her.)</p>

		<p>Close Reading Option 4: <span>Draw Inferences </span><br /><span>RL.6.1 </span></p>
		<p><span>Model Finding Text Evidence</span></p>
		<p>Distribute the graphic organizer BLM on the back cover of this guide. Explain that literary texts, including science fiction, have evidence in which the reader must make inferences—guessing what is happening through details the author provides. Tell students that today they will use the chart to identify text evidence that helps point out inferences in each science fiction story they read this week. Then support students to turn to the first story.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span><span> </span>On page 10 we learn that Gphimpy delivers all of Varuna’s training by mind merge. From this detail, we can infer that mind merge is a process in which one being transfers knowledge to another without spoken or written communication. The author doesn’t say this directly; instead, he supplies the details we need to figure it out on our own. On page 12, Varuna nourishes herself by drawing some energy from a nearby star. We can infer that Plynchins don’t eat food. On page 13, one planet Varuna interviews had huge creatures that ate tons of vegetation or other huge animals. These creatures went extinct. We can infer the creatures were dinosaurs, and the planet was Earth.</p>
		<p>Record this text evidence in the right column of the chart. </p>
		<p><span>Support Practice</span></p>
		<p>Ask students to work with a partner to locate two more inferences on page 19 in <span>An Attack on the Starship </span>Mayflower <span>in the Year 2647</span>. Remind them to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts. </p>
		<p>Bring students together and ask several pairs to share their text evidence and inference. Students should include story details such as: Crawling through four miles of the ship’s ductwork sounds like a computer simulation game Ace might design. (p. 19) We can infer that Ace is intelligent and creative with excellent computer skills. At the bottom of the page it says, “walking used up oxygen and nutrients, and those had to be budgeted.” We can infer that the starship inhabitants have not been able to exactly duplicate Earth’s system for supporting life. Record the information on the right column of the BLM chart.</p>
		<p><span>Find Text Evidence Independently</span></p>
		<p>Ask students to reread <span>An Attack on the Starship </span>Mayflower <span>in the Year 2647</span> independently to locate text evidence of another inference. (Possible inference: On page 26 Captain Trace takes Ace on the trip to explore Urn-ka-chee. We can infer that Ace will have more privileges now that he has helped stop the attack.) Record the text evidence on the right side of the BLM chart.</p>

		<p>Close Reading Option 5: <span>Answering Text Evidence Questions </span><span>RL.6.1, RL.6.3, RL.6.4</span></p>
		<p>Use these questions to extend close reading or challenge students who do not need modeling or support practice.</p>
		<p>Identify Cause and Effect</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> What was the effect of Varuna thinking about her excitement over her first job? </p>
		<p><span>Answer:</span><span> </span>She wasted 1.7 seconds, and the first few million beings she could have interviewed.</p>
		<p><span>Text Evidence:</span><span> </span>“‘My first job!’ exclaims Varuna, too excited not to say it out loud in her own language. ‘You just wasted 1.7 seconds. That’s the first few million beings you could have interviewed,’ Gphimpy barks mentally.”(p. 10)</p>
		<p>Determine the Meaning of Words and Phrases</p>
		<p><span>Question:</span> The word <span>sentient</span> is used throughout the first story. Reread the first two lines on page 10 and the last two lines on page 10. What does <span>sentient</span> mean? What evidence help the reader define the word? </p>
		<p><span>Definition:</span><span> </span>conscious, characterized by the senses </p>
		<p><span>Text Evidence:</span> “Gphimpy explains to Varuna that her job is to find every sentient being.” (p. 10) “With great delight, Varuna discovers dozens of new sentient races!”(p. 10)</p>
		<p>Extend Meaning</p>

		<p>Build Language, Vocabulary, and Comprehension <br /><span>L.6.1b, L.6.5a, L.6.6</span></p>
		<p><span>Use Reflexive Pronouns</span></p>
		<p>Explain that a reflexive pronoun is a word such as <span>herself, myself</span>, or <span>itself </span>that we use to refer to the subject of the sentence. For example, “I bought myself a pepperoni pizza.”</p>
		<p>Ask students to read the last paragraph on page 9 and talk with a partner to identify the reflexive pronoun. (Varuna finds herself in a smelly methane swamp…”) Have students tell what this reflexive pronoun refers to. (Varuna)</p>
		<p><span>Vocabulary Strategies: </span><span>Identify Onomatopoeia</span></p>
		<p>Together, read the “Tools Writer Use” section on page 4. </p>
		<p><span><span>Say:</span></span><span> </span><span>The science fiction we read includes onomatopoeia. Onomatopoeia suggests or imitates the sound an object makes. Writers use onomatopoeia to appeal to readers’ sense of hearing and make the plot more vivid and realistic. For example, “The horses in the parade clip-clopped down the street.” This is more vivid than if I say, “The horses in the parade walked down the street.”</span></p>
		<p>Model how to identify onomatopoeia by answering the “Analyze the Tools Writers Use” questions on page 17, asking students to locate each piece of onomatopoeia as you reference it in the text. Support practice by asking students to assist you in identifying the examples of onomatopoeia listed on page 17. </p>
		<p><span><span>Say:</span></span><span> </span><span>With a partner, answer the “Analyze the Tools Writer Use” questions on page 29, referring back to </span><span>An Attack on the Starship </span><span>Mayflower </span><span>in the Year 2647</span><span>. Invite students to begin collecting examples of onomatopoeia from their independent reading. Provide a large sheet of chart paper on which students can record their examples, and periodically review them as a class. </span></p>
		<p><span>Practice Academic Vocabulary</span></p>
		<p>Remind students that one type of context clues is heterographs, words that are pronounced the same but are spelled differently and have different meanings. Sometimes readers can figure out the meaning of an unfamiliar word by looking for heterographs in the text. Direct students to the “Focus on Words: Heterographs” activities on pages 4, 17, and 29. Ask them to copy the charts on a sheet of paper to complete with a partner. Explain that they should read the sentences around the boldfaced word to find a heterograph that helps define the word. Readers should beware of the different meanings and spellings. Partners should be able to explain how they know that the words are heterographs.</p>

		<p><span>Practice Finding Text Evidence</span></p>
		<p>Have students reread the text to find evidence to answer the questions on the Text Evidence Question Card.</p>
		<p>Write to Sources:<span> </span><span>Narrative Text</span></p>
		<p>Tell students they will write their own science fiction using the stories they read this week as models. Assist students through the step-by-step process detailed on pages 30–31, encouraging them to refer back to the “Features of Science Fiction” web on page 3 as well. Confer with individual students as they write. For example, did the student include an element based on scientific fact? Base the story on a futuristic, fantastic, or realistic setting? Use a theme of aliens, parallel universes, space and time travel, or inventions that go out of control?</p>
		<p><span>Make Connections Across Texts</span></p>
		<p><span><span>Say:</span></span><span> </span><span>Good readers think about how literary works are related. We know, for example, that both of these science fiction stories share certain features. They both have futuristic settings. They both have elements that are based on scientific fact. What else do they have in common? Today we will think about the elements in both stories and what we can learn from them. </span></p>
		<p><span>Ask students to copy the “Make Connections Across Texts” chart on the inside back cover of their books on a sheet of paper to complete individually, with a partner, or in a small group. Then bring students together to share and synthesize their ideas.</span></p>
		<p><span>Collaborative Research</span></p>
		<p>Divide the class into three groups. Have each group conduct collaborative research on one of the early authors of science fiction highlighted on page 3—Jonathan Swift, H. G. Wells, or Jules Verne. Students should use print and digital resources to research how science and technology were used and then write and publish their reports. If time allows, invite each group to present its report to the class. </p>
