      Then as you read Part I, use self-stick notes to identify the main
      characters, setting, and key events. Look for evidence to help you figure
      out what happened to the blue carbuncle and who committed the crime.

    <p>
      Remind students that visualizing as they read can help them identify key
      details and summarize what happened. Explain that this is especially
      important in a mystery because the author provides evidence about the
      crime and the criminal throughout the story. Have students turn to page 7.
      Reread the newspaper account on pages 7–8 together.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Ask:</span> What did you see happen at the hotel? Who is John
      Horner? What is his job? Why was he called to the Countess’s hotel room?
      What is Horner accused of doing?
    </p>

      Pair students and have them write a summary of the events you read about.

      Bring students together and ask several pairs of students to read their
      summaries aloud. As a whole group, evaluate the summaries and identify any
      key information that was omitted. Then write a group summary of the key
      ideas in Part I.

      Explain that in these questions readers are asked to find text evidence to
      identify specific words that describe Ryder and use that evidence to
      explain how they add to the tone and meaning of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Say:</span> I need to find words and phrases that describe Ryder,
      including his appearance and behavior.
    </p>
    <p>Reread page 19.</p>
    <p>
      <span>Say:</span> On page 19, the author describes how Ryder hesitates and
      gives “a sidelong glance” when he gives his name. The author also says
      that “A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger” who stood
      looking from side to side with “half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes” and
      later shows “nervous tension” as he clasps and unclasps his hands. These
      words show that Ryder is scared and nervous. This makes me think he is
      guilty and has something to hide.

    </p>
    <p>
      Bring students together and invite pairs to share their text evidence and
      identify their words and phrases. Students may identify descriptions such
      as “quivered with emotion,” “staggered to his feet,” and “stood glaring
      with a drawn face” on page 20 and “he sat staring with frightened eyes” on
      page 21. Students should use this evidence to explain how the author
      creates a sense of fear and uneasiness as Ryder realizes that Holmes knows
      the truth about his crime.
    </p>
    <p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
    <p>
      Ask students to independently review pages 22–24 to identify additional
      words and phrases describing Ryder. Then discuss how all the evidence
      students found contributes to the tone and meaning of the scene. Students
      may identify examples such as “a crackling voice,” “threw himself down
      suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion’s knees,” and “passed
      his tongue over his parched lips.” Students should use text evidence to
      explain that the author uses the descriptions of Ryder to convey a sense
      of uneasiness and fear that escalates into panic and finally a sense of
      hopelessness or resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discuss how this close reading has helped students find the variety of
      words and phrases Doyle uses to describe Ryder and how these descriptions
      contribute to the increasing fear and panic in Part III.

      Remind students that a deduction is figuring out something using evidence.
      Explain that the question asks readers to identify evidence of things
      Holmes figures out about the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Say:</span> I will need to look for text evidence that shows
      Holmes’s direct statements about the case as well as information inferred
      by the reader.
    </p>
    <p>Direct students to pages 5–6.</p>
    <p>
      <span>Say:</span> On page 5, Holmes refers to the blue stone as “
      <span>the</span> precious stone” and on page 6 he confirms that this is
      the jewel that was stolen from the Countess of Morcar. Holmes is able to
      determine the blue jewel that was inside the goose is actually the stolen
      blue carbuncle because he says he recognizes the jewel from reading about
      “its size and shape” in the newspaper “every day lately.”

      <span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> Ask students to

      that shows Holmes making another deduction about the case. Remind students

      clarify each other’s thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bring students together and invite pairs to share the evidence they found.
      Students should be able to explain that Holmes makes a deduction about Mr.
      Henry Baker’s connection to the disappearance of the jewel because he was
      carrying the goose that the jewel was hidden in. Students should cite text
      evidence that shows how Holmes makes a connection between the stone and
      Mr. Baker.
    </p>
    <p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
    <p>
      Ask students to independently review page 12 to find evidence of another
      deduction Holmes makes about Mr. Baker. (Students should explain that at
      this point in the story, Holmes thinks Mr. Baker is innocent and has no
      knowledge of the stolen jewel. Students may also note that Holmes has a
      plan to test Mr. Baker and find out whether his deduction is correct.)

    <p>
      Discuss how this close reading has helped students identify text evidence
      that shows what Holmes has figured out about the case based on the
      evidence he discovers.

    <p>
      Explain that this question asks readers to find text evidence that helps
      them decide why Holmes lets Ryder go at the end of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Say:</span> I will find text evidence that helps me decide why
      Holmes lets Ryder go instead of turning him in to the police.
    </p>
    <p>Reread the first and second sentences on page 30.</p>
    <p>
      <span>Say:</span> Holmes points out that he is not being paid by the
      police to solve crimes for them. He adds that there is no danger of Horner
      getting convicted of the crime because Ryder “will not appear against him,
      and the case must collapse.” This evidence shows me that Holmes does not
      think it is his responsibility to turn Ryder in as a criminal. It also
      shows that Holmes thinks letting Ryder go will actually help Horner, who
      was falsely accused of the crime.
    </p>
    <p>Support Practice</p>
    <p>Ask students to turn to page 30.</p>
    <p>
      <span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> Ask students to
      turn to a partner, reread the next four sentences on page 30, and find
      text evidence that allows them to draw an inference about Holmes’s
      decision to let Ryder go. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each
      other’s ideas, and ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bring students together and ask several pairs to share their inferences
      and the supporting text evidence. Students should be able to explain that
      Holmes believes Ryder is too scared to commit other crimes and the rest of
      his life would be wasted in jail if Holmes turned him in. Students should
      explain that this text evidence shows that Holmes wants to help Ryder, not
      punish him.
    </p>
    <p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
    <p>
      Ask students to reread the rest of the paragraph on page 30 independently.
      Tell them to find evidence that enables them to draw an inference about
      how Holmes views the end of the case. Students should be able to explain
      that to Holmes the most important thing is solving the case, not bringing
      Ryder to justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discuss how this close reading has helped students understand how Holmes’s
      decision to let Ryder go was motivated by his desire to help the man, his
      belief that this action would help clear Horner, and his belief that Ryder
      posed no further threat to society.

      Ask students to turn to the Comprehension chart on page 32. Explain that
      the chart serves as a way to summarize the key events in each part of the
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Say:</span> First we will briefly retell what happens in each part
      of the story. Then we will use this summary to explain how these events
      create the structure for the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distribute the graphic organizer BLM on back cover of this guide. Then
      support students to turn to page 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Say:</span> When we summarize, we retell only the most important
      events. We know that a mystery focuses on solving a crime. In Part I, we
      learn that a valuable blue carbuncle was stolen from a hotel room. Let’s
      list that as one of the key events in Part I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write “Blue carbuncle is stolen” on the chart. Have students review the
      rest of Part I and identify other events that should be included in a
      summary. Students should point out that Peterson brings a goose, a hat,
      and a jewel to Holmes, and asks Holmes to help him return the items. They
      may also note that John Horner has been charged with the crime and that
      Holmes places an ad addressed to Mr. Henry Baker. Add these events to the
      chart.
    </p>
    <p>Support Practice</p>
    <p>Direct students’ attention to the “Part II” box of the chart.</p>
    <p>
      <span>Collaborative conversation (turn and talk).</span> Ask students to
      turn to a partner, review Part II of the story, and identify the key
      events. Remind students to stay on topic, build on each other’s ideas, and
      ask questions to clarify each other’s thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bring students together and ask several pairs to summarize the events they
      identified. Students should identify these key events: Mr. Henry Baker
      visits Holmes, Holmes tests Baker by asking if he wants the leftover goose
      parts, Baker says that he got the goose from a man named Windigate, and
      Holmes determines that Baker had nothing to do with the stolen jewel. Have
      students add these events to their chart.
    </p>
    <p>Find Text Evidence Independently</p>
    <p>
      Direct students to complete the last section of the chart independently.
      Then have students use their summaries to explain how the events
      contribute to the structure of the plot. (Students should identify the key
      events in Part III as Holmes tracks down the original owner of the goose,
      James Ryder confesses to the crime and explains in detail what happened,
      and Holmes lets Ryder go free. Students should use these events to explain
      how Part I introduces the mystery and some evidence about the crime; Part
      II shows Holmes gathering information he can use to solve the mystery; and
      Part III shows how the mystery is solved and tells exactly how the crime
      was committed.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Discuss how this close reading has helped students understand how specific
      events contribute to the structure of the mystery, including how it is
      solved.

    <p><span>Question:</span> What do Peterson’s actions reveal about him?</p>
    <p>
      <span>Answer:</span> I can tell that he is an honest person because when
      his wife gives him the blue carbuncle he tries to return it to the person
      who lost it rather than keep it for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Text Evidence:</span> “‘See here, sir! See what my wife found in its

    <p>
      <span>Question:</span> How did the blue carbuncle get from John Ryder’s
      possession to <br />Mr. Henry Baker’s possession?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Answer:</span> John Ryder hid the jewel inside a goose that was sold
      by his sister to a salesman. The salesman sold the goose to Mr. Windigate,
      who then gave it to Mr. Baker, who had been paying money every week so he
      could get a goose at Christmas.

    <p>Ensure That Pronouns Are in the Proper Case</p>
    <p>
      Review with students the difference between a subjective pronoun and an
      objective pronoun. Explain that the former functions as a subject in a
      sentence and the latter functions as an object. List examples of each
      type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have students identify the pronouns as you read this sentence from page
      10: “<span
        >. . . but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which
        caused him to drop his bird.</span
      >”
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the sentence and underline the pronouns <span>he</span> and
      <span>him</span>. Tell students that <span>he</span> functions as the
      subject of the clause “<span>he</span
      ><span> must have bitterly regretted the impulse</span>” and&#160;<span
        >him</span
      >
      functions as the object of the verb <span>caused</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continue this lesson by displaying the following sentences and asking
      students to identify which pronouns correctly complete each sentence and
      explain why:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I/Me asked he/him to tell we/us where him/he got the goose.</li>
      <li>
        After they/them attacked him/we, they/them disappeared down an alley.

    <p>Analyze Figures of Speech</p>

      Have students turn to the vocabulary activity on the inside back cover.
      Read aloud the directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Say:</span> Authors often use figurative language, such as simile
      and metaphor, to describe things by comparing them to something else.
      Let’s look at the language the author uses to describe the blue carbuncle.
    </p>
    <p>Have students turn to page 11.</p>
    <p>Read aloud the first four sentences.</p>
    <p>
      <span>Say:</span> Holmes refers to the blue jewel as a “nucleus and focus
      of crime.” I can use a dictionary to determine that a
      <span>nucleus</span> is “the central part of something.” The story focuses
      on the theft of the blue carbuncle. Now I understand that this phrase
      means <br />the jewel is at the center of a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ask students to work in pairs to determine the meaning of the next two
      phrases. Remind them to use print or online resources, including notes in
      the text, to determine the meaning of any unknown words. Then have
      students share the meanings they wrote for the phrases with the class.

      Have students reread the text to find evidence to answer the questions on
      the Text Evidence Question Card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write to Sources:<span> </span><span><span>Narrative Fiction</span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Have students demonstrate their understanding of
      <span>The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle</span> by responding to the
      text-dependent writing prompt on the inside back cover. Rubrics to help
      you evaluate students’ writing are available in the online teacher’s
      guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Narrative Fiction.</span> The mystery of the blue carbuncle is
      revealed at the end when the thief, James Ryder, confesses. Based on his
      confession, write a narrative from Ryder’s point of view about the theft
      and his discovery. Include his thoughts, emotions, and details from his
      perspective. Incorporate dialogue, and use specific details from the story
      to inform your writing.
    </p>
    <p>Practice Academic Vocabulary</p>
    <p>
      Ask partners to choose four words from the glossary and compose oral
      sentences that demonstrate their understanding of the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then have students use digital or print resources to find antonyms for the
      glossary words <span>concise </span>and <span>scrupulous</span>. Have them
      write sentence pairs that include the glossary word in the first sentence
      and its antonym in the second sentence.
    </p>
    <p>Collaborative Research</p>
    <p>
      Have partners conduct collaborative research on the topic of Sir Arthur
      Conan Doyle. <br />Have them use print and digital resources to learn
      about the life and work of Doyle, including his careers as both a doctor
      and a writer. Have them take notes and then write and publish their
      reports. As an additional challenge, have students present their reports
      to the class.
