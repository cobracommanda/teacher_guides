Some evidence are direct definitions, others are examples, and still others are descriptions. We’re going to read closely to figure out the meaning of words using context clues.

In the first paragraph, the author states that there are two categories of habitats: land and water, which are also referred to as terrestrial and aquatic. The author provides an example of one type of terrestrial habitat: temperate woodland. I know that woodland is a type of habitat that is on land, not water, so </span><span>terrestrial </span><span>must mean “having to do with habitats on land.” I can check the definition in the glossary if I’m unsure.</span></p>

Or, write a cause-and-effect essay describing what happens when a living organism is unable to adapt to its environment.   </p>
		<p><span>Narrative prompt. </span>Select a species described in this book. Write a first-person narrative in the voice of that species describing your ancestors’ success or failure at becoming adapted to their environment and the consequences.</p>
		<p>Collaborative Research <span>W.6–6.7, W.6–6.8, W.6–6.9</span></p>
		<p>Have students collaborate to complete the research project outlined on the inside back cover of the text. Use the research project as a context in which to support students’ online research skills and to strengthen students’ presentation skills by requiring them to present their findings formally.</p>
		<p>Closed-Book Content Assessment <span>RST.6.7, RST.6.8</span></p>
		<p>You may wish to have students complete a formal content assessment available in this guide (BLMs 2 and 3) and online. This assessment helps you evaluate students’ understanding of the standards-based concepts developed in the text. More information about the question types and an answer key are also available online. <br />An answer key is provided on page 13 of this guide. </p>
		<p>Answer Key</p>
		<p>Content Assessment</p>
		<p>1. adapted</p>
		<p>2. Sample answer:</p>
		<p>3. Sample answer: Cactuses have an extensive system of shallow roots that allows them to quickly absorb as much water as possible before any moisture is evaporated in the hot, dry air. They can also store water in their green stems. Its sharp, needle-like spines allow the cactus to reduce water loss through transpiration and evaporation as well as prevent animals from chewing the water-rich stems. </p>
		<p>4. Sample answer: Large geographic areas could be altered, polar bears would have nowhere to live, and they could become extinct.</p>
		<p>5. Sample answer: Darwin noticed that the tortoises on the different islands were not the same. This discovery made him wonder if the tortoises had become adapted to different conditions, such as weather, on the different islands, causing them to have variations.</p>
		<p>6. Sample answer: In natural selection, nature ultimately determines which variation of a species is strongest and most desirable while in selective breeding, humans determine which traits are the best.</p>
		<p>7. Sample answer: The first dinosaurs came about during the Triassic period. By the end of the Cretaceous period they were extinct.</p>
		<p>8. Sample answer: Answers will vary, but one example is the duck-billed platypus and the mallard duck. They have similar-shaped bills, which they use to push through mud to find food, but they are unrelated species with no ancestors in common.</p>
		<p>9. extinction</p>
