		<p>Read aloud the supporting question on page 6: How does the environment affect living things?</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> As you read this chapter, you will use a strategy called Cluster Notes to help you “cluster” information about living things and their environments.</p>
		<p>Display the Cluster Notes sample shown in the right margin.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>Cluster Notes are a way to organize information as you read. You’ll write the main concept of the chapter in the center circle and jot notes about the subtopics in the surrounding circles. The supporting facts and details for each subtopic will be written in the ring of circles surrounding it. Cluster Notes will help you group and link information.</span></p>
		<p>Read aloud page 8 and model how you jot key information using the Cluster Notes organizer.</p>
		<p>Have students create a Cluster Notes organizer on notebook paper, or distribute copies of BLM 1.</p>
		<p>Instruct students to read page 7 and write the chapter’s main concept in the center circle. As they read, have them jot down the subtopics in the surrounding circles. Explain that students may use whatever concise note-taking method helps them capture the information easily and accurately (single words, phrases, abbreviations, symbols, drawings, etc.).</p>
		<p>Summarize Key Concepts: Think and Write Together</p>
		<p>Invite students to share their Cluster Notes. What key concepts did they write in the center circle? What subtopics did they note in the surrounding circles? How do the notes they recorded around each subtopic connect to it? Allow time for students to share and discuss their findings with the class and summarize what they learned.</p>
		<p>As a group, construct a two- to three-sentence written summary of the key ideas in the chapter. If students need more support to summarize the text, explicitly model strategies for summarizing.</p>
		<p>Model Summarizing</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> When we summarize, we include only the most important information in a text. We look for the central ideas. We don’t include all of the details. Let’s summarize a section of this chapter together.</p>
		<p>Reread page 12.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> This section is about niches. I ask myself, “What is the central idea the author wants me to understand about niches?”</p>
		<p>Allow responses. Support students to recognize that the author wants them to understand that each species has a unique strategy for survival, or niche.  To help students visualize this idea, the author provides specific examples of animals and their niches.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> In my summary, I will include only the central idea. I will not include examples of specific animals’ niches.</p>

		<p><span>Say:</span> This text uses words and phrases specific to living things and their environments. <span>Sometimes a direct definition or context clues don’t provide enough information to thoroughly understand the meaning of a word.

		<p>Reread the section “What is an Ecosystem?” on page 8. Highlight the term <span>ecosystems</span> in the first sentence.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> <span>The author describes an ecosystem as consisting of “all the living and nonliving things in one area that interact with each other.” She also explains that ecosystems can be “big or small.”  This explanation doesn’t tell me what an ecosystem is.  If I knew of an example of an ecosystem, I might understand better what one is.  So, I ask myself, “What is an example of an ecosystem?” As I read on, the author gives examples of both a small ecosystem: a single, rotting tree stump—and a very large one: Earth. Now I understand what ecosystems are and how they can differ in size and type.</span></p>

		<p>Explain that the question asks the reader to find evidence in the text that supports a specific inference.</p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> I’m going to show you how I make inferences when I read. When we infer, we use information from the text to form an understanding that is not directly stated in the text. To make an inference, I need to read the text very closely and think about what the author is explaining. I also need to support the inference I make with evidence from the text to make sure that my inference makes sense.</p>

		<p><span>Say:</span> The author explains that the atmosphere filters out dangerous radiation from the sun as well as provides oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, all of which are essential for living things.   Although the author does not state it directly, this evidence allows us to infer that without the atmosphere we wouldn’t survive.</p>

		<p>Extend Language Concepts: Dependent Clauses</p>
		<p>Read the following sentence from page 8:</p>
		<p><span>“If the ecosystem is a pond, the community includes all the birds, fish, insects, and plants that interact in the pond.”</span></p>
		<p><span><span>Say:</span></span><span> There are many examples of dependent clauses in this book. A dependent clause is a part of a sentence that has a subject and a verb but is not a complete sentence. Dependent clauses begin with signal words such as </span>if<span> in this example. Other signal words include but are not limited to </span><span>after</span>, <span>although</span>, <span>as</span>, <span>because</span>,<span> before</span>, <span>since</span>, <span>unless</span>, <span>until</span>, <span>whether</span><span>, </span><span>when</span><span>, and </span><span>while</span><span>.</span></p>
		<p>Have students work in pairs to look through the book for additional examples of dependent clauses. Ask students to share their findings. Monitor and provide feedback as necessary. Record the dependent clauses on a chart to refer to throughout the rest of the unit.</p>
		<p>Turn and talk. Challenge partners to compose other oral sentences with dependent clauses based on information in the text. Have partners share their sentences with the rest of the class and explain how the dependent clauses affect their sentences.</p>
		<p>Extend Language Concepts:<span> </span><span>Quantitative Adjectives  </span></p>
		<p>Read the following sentences from page 8:</p>
		<p><span>“Each ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving things in one area that interact with each other.”</span></p>
		<p><span>Say:</span> An adjective is a word that describes something. A quantitative adjective is an adjective that describes a quantity. It indicates how many or how few. In this example, there are several quantitative adjectives: <span>each</span>, <span>all</span>, and <span>one</span>. They tell how many. Other quantitative adjectives include <span>some</span>, <span>many</span>, <span>much</span>, and <span>every</span>.</p>
		<p>Read the following sentence from page 22:</p>
		<p><span>“</span>Cold or very dry places produce little vegetation<span>.”</span></p>
		<p><span><span>Say</span></span><span>:</span>  The word <span>little</span><span> </span>in this sentence is a quantitative adjective. Remember that a quantitative adjective describes a quantity or amount. This word describes the amount of vegetation, which is little.</p>
		<p>Have students work in pairs to find more examples of quantitative adjectives. Have them list the sentences in which the adjective is used. As students share their findings, record them on chart paper under the title “Examples of Quantitative Adjectives.”</p>

		<p>Writing to Sources</p>
		<p>Use one of the text-dependent writing prompts below, or create one of your own, to give students the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the concepts covered in the text. Rubrics to help you evaluate students’ writing are available in the Digital Teacher’s Guide (BenchmarkUniverse.com).</p>
		<p><span>Argument prompt.</span>  Write a clear, well-organized speech arguing against human activities that negatively affect the atmosphere, such as burning fossil fuels and clearing forests.  Provide facts from the text to support your argument, including the role the atmosphere plays in our survival. Make sure that your essay has a clear introduction and concluding section.</p>
		<p><span>Informative/explanatory prompt.</span> Select one of the cycles of nature described in this book. Then using a sequence text structure, describe the process. Use sequence signal words in your explanation.</p>
		<p><span>Narrative prompt.</span> Look at the photo on pages 34-35. Imagine you were one of the bighorn rams, but it is now a few years later, and you are showing this photo to your baby lamb. Describe to your lamb why this fight, or competition, was so important both for your survival and for your lamb’s.</p>
		<p>Collaborative Research</p>
		<p>Have students collaborate to complete the research project outlined on the inside back cover of the text. Use the research project as a context in which to support students’ online research skills and to strengthen students’ presentation skills by requiring them to present their findings formally.</p>
		<p>Closed-Book Content Assessment</p>
		<p>You may wish to have students complete a formal content assessment available in this guide (BLMs 2 and 3) and online.

		<p>Living Things and Their Environments: <br />Content Assessment</p>
		<p><span><span>Directions:</span></span><span> </span>Use what you have learned about living things and their environments to answer the following questions.</p>
		<p>Chapter 1</p>
		<ol>
			<li>All living things on Earth make up the ______________.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>biosphere</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Give two examples of biotic and two examples of abiotic factors in a meadow ecosystem.</li>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			<li>In the past few decades, scientists have discovered a set of very unusual ocean ecosystems around hot, volcanic vents in the seafloor. These ecosystems are too deep underwater to rely on energy from the sun; instead, they rely on energy from breaking down certain chemicals emitted by the vents. Special bacteria and other tiny organisms have the “job” of capturing this energy and serving as a food source for the other organisms in the ecosystem. <br /><br />Given this information, which organisms occupy the niche most similar to these bacteria on land?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Plants are the primary producers on land, occupying the niche most similar to the tiny ocean organisms at the vents.</p>
		<p>Chapter 2</p>
		<ol>
			<li> Herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores are types of ____________________________.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>consumers</p>
		<ol>
			<li> What part is missing from the food chain below?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>su</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Many plants depend upon honeybees for pollination. In recent years, the number of bees has sharply declined in many areas. How might the decline of bees in a certain area affect an animal that eats only meat and does not eat bees or honey?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Sample answer: The pure carnivore that eats only meat might depend on a plant-eating animal for its food supply. If that animal depends on a plant that in turn depends on bees for pollination, the disappearance of bees could affect the carnivore indirectly.</p>
		<p>Chapters 3 and 4</p>
		<ol>
			<li> The four chemicals necessary for all living things are ______________________________.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>nitrogen, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide</p>
		<ol>
			<li> Imagine that a fire destroyed a large section of forest. What might be one short-term change and one long-term ecosystem change linked to this event?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Answers may vary. Short-term: fast-growing weeds and grasses grow in where forest used to be. Long-term: A different type of forest arises as it eventually grows back.</p>
		<ol>
			<li> It is well known that some places (for example, rain forests) have a greater number of species than other places. What are some possible reasons this might be the case?<br /><br /><br /><br /></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Answers may vary but should be logical and make some connection to a relatively greater number of available niches or abundance of resources, or age/stability of the system that allowed time for greater diversity to develop.</p>
		<ol>
			<li> In each portion of the circle below, write an event that could cause an ecosystem to change. Then explain how each effect can cause further change. <span>Answers may vary. Students may include short-term natural disasters such as fires, storms, insect population explosions, volcanic eruptions, etc., as well as long-term events such as temperature changes (global warming), human factors such as strip mining, pollution, destruction of forests, and so on.
